I will bless the Lord forever 
I will trust Him at all times 
He has delivered me from all fears 
He has set my feet upon a rock
I will not be moved 
And I'll say of the Lord 

You are my shield, my strength        
My portion, Deliverer 
My shelter, strong tower 
My very present help in time of need 

Whom have I in heaven but You 
There's none I desire besides You 
You have made me glad 
And I'll say of the Lord
