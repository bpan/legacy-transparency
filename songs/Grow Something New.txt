Lord, you’re the keeper of what You grow. 
You water, You guard, for fruit to show; 
For mercy and justice to flow. 
You planted the vineyard, our needs You know. 

Grow something new in our lives, oh God. 
Grow something peaceful, grow something true. 
Grow something new in our lives (hearts) oh God. 
Grow something new, turn our hope back to You.

Turn our hope back to You. 
Give us hope that’s in You.
