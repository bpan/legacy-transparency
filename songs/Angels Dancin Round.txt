Angels dancin’ round, 
As I hear the sound of You 
Is this you drawing near, O Lord 
Please come take away my fear 

To open up again 
To open up again… my friend 

There is no place I’d rather be 
O Lord than here beholding thee 
Open up my eyes so I can 
See your beauty Lord, 
Your beauty Lord 

When I am weak, Lord you are strong 
Help me through the day 
When it’s so long 
I run into your open arms of love 

The way you move takes away my fear 
The way you move lets me know you are near 
The way you move captivates my soul 
The way you move it makes me whole
