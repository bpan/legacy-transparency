Make me a prayer, let my prayers be a cry. 
Humble my heart so that You may draw nigh. 
Cause me to stand and cry out for this land. 
Cause me to be one whoâ€™s set free, 
To stand as a house of prayer. 
 
Make us a prayer, let our prayers be a cry. 
Humble our hearts so that You may draw nigh. 
Cause us to stand and cry out for this land. 
Cause us to be a people set free. 
Who will stand as a house of prayer.
