Let there be praise, 
Let there be joy in our hearts, 
Sing to the Lord, give Him the glory.  

Let there be praise, 
Let there be joy in our hearts, 
Forevermore, let His love fill the air and 
Let there be praise. 

He inhabits the praise of His people 
And dwells deep within.  
The peace that He gives none can equal, 

His love it knows no end.  
So lift your voices, with gladness sing.  
Proclaim to all the earth 
That Jesus Christ is King. 

When the Spirit of God is within us, 
We will overcome. 
In our weakness His strength will defend us 
His praise is on our tongue.  

So lift your voices, with gladness sing.  
Proclaim to all Earth 
That Jesus Christ is King.
