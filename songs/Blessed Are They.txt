Blessed are they that know the joyful sound. 
Blessed are they that know the joyful sound. 
They shall walk in the light, 
The light of His countenance. 
They shall walk in the light of the Lord. 

In Your name shall we rejoice all day. 
In Your name shall we rejoice all day. 
 We shall be exalted, 
By Your righteousness. 
For You are the glory of our strength.
 
You have anointed us with sacred oil, 
And the songs of Zion burn within, oh yeah! 
Oh Lord, release to us the supernatural sounds, 
The sounds of deliverance. 
So when men hear theyâ€™ll fear Your name, 
And obey the call to follow, follow.
