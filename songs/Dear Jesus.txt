Dear Jesus, Thou art everything to me. 
And everything I own I give to Thee. 
My wealth, my all, but most of all, 
Dear Lord, I give myself to Thee. 

Dear Jesus, Thou hast bled and died for me 
And washed away my sins on Calvary. 
You cleansed my soul, You made me whole 
Dear Lord, I give myself to Thee. 

Dear Jesus, Thou hast led me day by day. 
And set my will to follow all the way. 
To bear the cross, to suffer loss; 
Dear Lord, I give myself to Thee.
