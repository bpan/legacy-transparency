Jesus we will prepare an altar 
Jesus we will bring costly gifts. 
Jesus we will lift up an offering 
The fruit of our lips. 
 
Jesus we will make straight a highway, 
Jesus we will prepare Your way. 
Jesus we will mature as people 
A people of praise.
 
We will raise up a standard…of praise. 
 (We raise a standard of praise) 
Receive, Lord this offering…we raise. 
 (Receive this offering we raise) 
We raise up a standard of praise to Your glory 
Your glorious Name, O Lord, 
A standard of praise.
 
We will raise up a standard…of praise. 
 (We raise a standard of praise) 
Receive, Lord this offering…we raise. 
 (Receive this offering we raise) 
We raise up a standard of praise in the nations 
And hallow Your name, Most High 
With a standard of praise. 
 
We raise a standard of praise 
Receive this offering we raise
