Oh let the Son of God enfold you 
With His Spirit and His love. 
Let Him fill your heart and satisfy your soul. 

Oh let Him have the things that hold you 
And His Spirit like a dove will descend 
Upon your life and make you whole.
 
Jesus, oh Jesus, come and fill Your lambs. 
Jesus, oh Jesus, come and fill Your lambs.
 
Oh come and sing this song with gladness 
As your hearts are filled with joy. 
Lift your hands in sweet surrender to His name. 
Oh give Him all your tears and sadness 
Give Him  all  your years of pain and you’ll 
Enter into life in Jesus’ name.
