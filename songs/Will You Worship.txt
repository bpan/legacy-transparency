Deep in my soul, there’s a tug of war.  
I’m struggling to know what this life is for 
I try so hard to stay in control.  
To hold back the tears, to not let go.  

I don’t know why, I hang on so long. 
When I know the question 
You are asking me 

Will you worship, 
Will you bow down before 
Your Lord and King.  
Will you love Me, 
Will you give Me your heart 
Your everything. 

Right here and now, I make my choice.  
With all my love, I will answer You. 

I will worship, I will bow down before, 
My Lord and King. 
I will love You, I will give You my heart, 
My everything.
