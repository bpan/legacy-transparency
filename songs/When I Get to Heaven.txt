When I get to heaven gonna walk with Jesus 
When I get to heaven gonna see His face. 
When I get to heaven gonna talk with Jesus 
Saved by His wonderful grace. 

Because I’m saved, saved, wonderfully saved 
Washed by the blood of the lamb. 
Saved, saved, wonderfully saved 
And I’m so glad I am, halleluia…
