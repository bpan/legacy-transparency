When I can’t see You, I know You’re here, 
When I can’t feel You, I will not fear, 
I will trust in You and I will not be afraid. 

And when the battle, is close at hand 
I know You’re with me to help me stand. 
I will trust in You and I will not be afraid.
 
I will not,  I will not 
Be afraid,  be afraid   (2x) 
I will trust in You, I will trust in You 
 I will trust in You.
 
And when the darkness is closing in 
And I am running against the wind 
I will trust in You and I will not be afraid.
 
Cause when I’m standing up on that shore, 
And all the battles, they have gone before, 
I will trust in You and I will not be afraid.
