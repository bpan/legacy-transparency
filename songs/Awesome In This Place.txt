As I come into Your presence, 
Past the gates of praise 
Into Your sanctuary, 
Till weâ€™re standing face to face 

I look upon Your countenance, 
I see the fullness of Your grace 
I can only bow down and say 

You are awesome in this place, 
Mighty God 
You are awesome in this place, 
Abba Father 

You are worthy of our praise, 
To You our lives we raise 
You are awesome in this place, 
Mighty God
