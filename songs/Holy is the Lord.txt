We stand and lift up our hands 
For the joy of the Lord is our strength 
We bow down worship Him now 
How great, how awesome is He 

And together we sing 
Everyone sings 

Holy is the Lord 
God Almighty 
The Earth is filled with His glory 

Holy is the Lord 
God Almighty 
The Earth is filled with His glory 
The Earth is filled with His glory 

It’s rising up 
All around 
It’s the anthem of 
The Lord’s renown
