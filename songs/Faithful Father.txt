Father, I canâ€™t explain this kind of love, 
This kind of grace 
I know, I still break Your heart 
And yet You run to welcome me. 

This is my song of praise to You 
For who You are and all that You do. 
From the moment my life began, 
You have been faithful. 

Father, I love the way You hold me close 
And say my name 
I know, when my life is through, 
My heart will find its home in You 

You will be faithful, 
Forever faithful, Father.
