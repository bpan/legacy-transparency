We serve a God of miracles, 
You heal the sick and open blinded eyes 
We serve a God of miracles, 
The demons flee the moment You arise 

Arise, and show Yourself strong.  
Arise, arise and show Yourself  strong. 

We serve a God of power, 
We serve a God of might, 
We serve a God of signs and wonder. 
We serve a God of power, 
We serve a God of might, 
You speak and all creation thunders.
