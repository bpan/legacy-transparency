See the scars, feel the pain, 
Know the hurting that they know, what’s the gain? 
Like a winter’s driving rain, 
It falls so hard and who’s to blame? 

We who know, we must go 
Take the message of the man long ago. 
Tell the people everywhere 
To look in faith at one who cares.
 
And you will see the scars, 
See the scars of One who died for you. 
See the blood that Jesus shed for you. 
Take the mercy that He offers you.
 
O, can’t you see the scars, 
Scars that take the sting of death away, 
Scars that pay what we would never pay, 
Scars that promise us a better day.  See the scars.
 
Take a look, take the time, 
See behind the frozen eyes to battered minds. 
It’s a world of desperate need 
And will we simply watch them bleed?
