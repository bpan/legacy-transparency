There is joy in the Lord, 
There is love in His Spirit, 
There is hope in the knowledge of Him. 

There’s a fountain that flows 
Like a river from heaven, 
Abounding in love to my soul. 

All blessing and honor are His, 
All glory and power are His. 
Let all wisdom and strength 
Be the Lord’s in this place, 
Let all glory be given to Him. 

There is joy in the Lord, 
There is love in His Spirit, 
There is hope in the knowledge of Him. 

There’s a fountain that flows 
Every time I am near it. 
My heart overflows to the Lord.
