Jesus, You’re the precious pearl. 
There’s no other in all the world. 
So beautiful, who is like You. 
 
Jesus, You’re the cornerstone 
Your foundation will stand alone. 
No other love can satisfy.
 
You are my portion 
You are my satisfaction. 
Nothing else can take the place of loving You.
 
You’re my inheritance 
Not as the world can give. 
Your love is like a buried treasure 
A precious pearl beyond all measure 
Beautiful, so valuable.
