Your love is better than all things 
Your love is better than all things 
And I don’t have the strength of words 
To tell You truly how I feel 
 
Your love is better than life 
Your love is better than life 
And I don’t have the strength of words 
To tell You truly how I feel
 
My God, You are the only One 
For me, the only One for me 
My God, Your love is better than all other loves 
And now You’re drawing me 
And I just want to be closer to You
 
Wanna get closer 
Wanna get closer to You…
