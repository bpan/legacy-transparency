You have given us a call to follow 
Day by day with standards 
Not our own. 
No one can serve two masters 
So with undivided hearts 
We choose to follow You alone.

Break the fear of man 
Within our hearts; 
Send Your fire 
And make us set apart.

Tear down the idols 
And make us fully Yours. 
We surrender all and nothing less 
As worship to You Lord.
