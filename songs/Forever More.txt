Oh Lord, you have given to me all I need 
And I pray for your will to be done. 
And I ask for your Spirit to work in my life 
That I can be a blessing to You. 

Holy One, you’re the light in my darkest day 
Showing me, the power of your truth. 
And I ask for the touch of Your Spirit in me, 
Giving me the faith to believe. 

And I will stand here, lost in Your love, 
And I will worship, forever more 
And I will stand here, ever amazed, 
And I will worship, forever more 
Forever more… 

Oh Lord, you are all that I need 
(Forever more)
