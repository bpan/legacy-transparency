Just the time I think that I’m 
At peace with the world that’s mine. 
I feel at ease, I feel at home 
And I know I’m not alone. 

Then in my rest, there comes a test 
That shakes me, ‘til again I know 
That what I’ve had is not enough 
And again I’ve got to grow.
 
Lord, I want to know You more 
Deep within my heart, I want to know You 
Lord, I want to know You 
And I would give my final breath 
To know You in Your death and resurrection 
Lord, I want to know You more 
Lord, I want to know You more
 
The full supply I find as I 
move closer to the heart of God 
To strengthen me, to nourish me, 
and to fill my mind with Him.
 
I’ve truly grown, but even so 
My hunger hasn’t gone away. 
Still I long, still I thirst 
To know Him more each day.
