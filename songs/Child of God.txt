Life laid down, crucified 
Arms stretched out and open wide 
To rescue me, so I could be a child of God

From nail-pierced hands and thorn pierced brow, 
Your love flowed down to me somehow 
It rescued me, so I could be a child of God 

Praise to the Lamb that was slain 
Praise to the Father, who gave His son away 

The proof of love, the price of grace 
You traded all to take my place 
And died for me so I could be a child of God 
You died for me so I could be a child of God
