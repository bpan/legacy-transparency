We want to see… 
We want to see… 
We want to see Jesus lifted high (2x) 

We want to see Jesus lifted high, 
A banner that flies across the land 
That all men may see the Truth and know 
He is the Way to heaven. 

Step by step we’re moving forward 
Minute by minute we’re taking ground 
Every prayer a powerful weapon 
Strongholds come tumbling down
