There’s none like You, oh Holy Lord 
No one like You among all the nations 
Who’d not fear You 
For it’s Your due, oh Lord 
No one’s like You, oh Holy Lord 
 
No one greater in majesty 
No one greater in righteousness 
No one greater in love, in all creation
 
Who’d not fear You 
For it’s Your due, oh Lord 
No one’s like You, oh Holy Lord
