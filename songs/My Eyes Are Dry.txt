My eyes are dry, my faith is old, 
My heart is hard, my prayers are cold, 
And I know how I ought to be. 
Alive in You, and dead to me. 

Oh what can be done, 
For an old heart like mine. 
Soften it up with oil and wine.  
The oil is You, A Spirit of love.  
Please wash me anew 
In the wine of Your blood.
