Blessed are those who dwell in Your house 
They are ever praising You 
Blessed are those whose strength is in You, 
Whose hearts are set on our God 

We will go from strength to strength 
Till we see you face to face

Hear our prayer, O Lord God Almighty. 
Come bless our land, as we seek You 
Worship You
