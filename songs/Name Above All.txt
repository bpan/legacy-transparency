I am not ashamed 
Of the name above all names 
For it has the power to heal and to save. 
Strength for the weary, 
Peace to the troubled soul.     
Peace to the troubled soul. 

It’s the name of Jesus.  
It’s the name of Jesus. 

Mightier than mountains, 
He lives among the weak. 
Ruler eternal, lover to me. 
Jesus, name above all, 
Jesus, name above all.
