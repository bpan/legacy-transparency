So many times Iâ€™ve failed 
And I have turned away. 
But I will never leave, 
For You are so faithful. 

I can just see in You 
All that is just and true, 
Less of me, more of You, 
I am Your servant. 

I want to be faithful to You, 
I want to be true Lord. 
Whatever You say, 
I will do, I will obey. 

Help me to walk in truth, 
Never to stray from You. 
Lead me in righteousness, 
I want to follow. 

Teach me to lose my life, 
That I would be found in You. 
Better to lose it all, 
To be found in Jesus.
