I will worship
With all of my heart.
I will praise You
With all of my strength.

I will seek You
All of my days.
I will follow
All of Your ways.

I will give You all my worship 
I will give You all my praise. 
You alone I long to worship 
You alone are worthy of my praise.
 
I will bow down
Hail You as King.
I will serve You
Give You everything.
 
I will lift up
My eyes to Your throne.
And I will trust You
I will trust You alone.
