You have my heart 		
And I am Yours forever 
You are my strength 
God of grace and power 

And everything You hold in Your hand 	
Still You make time for me 
I canâ€™t understand 

Praise You God of Earth and sky 
How beautiful is Your unfailing love 
Unfailing love 

And You never change, God You remain 
The Holy One, and my Unfailing Love 
Unfailing love 

You are my rock
The one I hold on to
You are my song
And I sing for You
