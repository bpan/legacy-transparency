This is my desire, to honor You.  
Lord, with all my heart, I worship You. 
All that is within me, I give You praise. 
All that I adore, is in You. 

Lord, I give you my heart, 
I give you my soul. 
I live for You alone. 

Every breath that I take. 
Every moment Iâ€™m awake.  
Lord, have Your way in me.
