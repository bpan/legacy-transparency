You are so good to me
You heal my broken heart
You are my Father in Heaven  (repeat)

You are beautiful, my sweet, sweet song  (3X)
I will sing again

You ride upon the clouds
You lead me to the truth
You are the Spirit inside me  (repeat)


You are my strong melody
You are my dancing rhythm
You are my perfect rhyme
And I want to sing forever


You poured out all your blood
You died upon the cross
You are my Jesus who loves me  (repeat)


You are my Father in Heaven
You are the Spirit inside me
You are my Jesus who loves me
