Come let us worship and bow down.  
Let us kneel before the Lord 
Our God our Maker. 

Come let us worship and bow down.  
Let us kneel before the Lord 
Our God our Maker. 
 
For He is our God, 
And we are the people of His pasture. 
And the sheep of His hand, 
Just the sheep of His hand. 
Come Let Us Worship & Bow Down
