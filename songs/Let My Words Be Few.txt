You are God in heaven 
And here am I on earth 
So I’ll let my words be few 
Jesus, I am so in love with You 

And I’ll stand in awe of You 
And I’ll stand in awe of You  
And I’ll stand in awe of You 
And I’ll let my words be few 
Jesus, I am so in love with You 

The simplest of all love songs 
I want to bring to you 
So I’ll let my words be few 
Jesus I am so in love with You
