It has always been You 
You have always been. 
Kingdoms rise and fall 
Yours will never end. 
 
It has always been You 
Before the world began 
You chose us as Your own 
And before You now we stand.
 
We honor You, esteem You 
We place You at the center 
In all of life we defer 
To Your rule and reign.
 
It has always been You 
It will always be You 
And itâ€™s You here and now we adore.
