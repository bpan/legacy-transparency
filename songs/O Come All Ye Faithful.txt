O come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant 
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem. 
Come and behold Him, born the King of angels

O come let us adore Him 
O come let us adore Him 
O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord

Sing choirs of angels, sing in adoration 
Sing all ye citizens of heaven above 
“Glory to God, glory in the highest!”

Ye Lord we greet thee, on this happy morning 
Jesus, to thee be all glory giv’n 
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing
