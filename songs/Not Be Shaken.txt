I will declare my choice to the nations, 
Shout for joy in the congregation.  
I will worship God (worship God), 
All my days 

Those who love the Lord are satisfied, 
those who trust in Him are Justified  
I will serve my God (Serve my God), 
All my days 

When the nations crumble, 
 (The Word of the Lord will stand)
Kings may rise and fall, 
 (His love will endure)
Though the strong may stumble, 
 (Oh the joy of the Lord is strength.)
To my soul. 

I will not be shaken, 
I will not be moved, 
I will not be shaken.
