Go ye therefore to every nation 
Preach the Gospel in every land. 
To  every language and every people, 
In My name reach out your hand. 
 
Tell the world the message, take it everywhere, 
To every tribe and nation we are called to share.
 
Go ye therefore to every neighbor 
Share My love with every man. 
The world will know that you are Mine if 
In My name you reach out your hand.
 
Tell the world, oh, tell the world 
Go ye and tell 
Tell the world, oh tell the world 
Go ye and tellâ€¦
