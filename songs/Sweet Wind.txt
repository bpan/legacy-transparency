There’s a wind a blowin’ 
All across the land. 
A fragrant breeze of heaven 
Blowing once again. 

Don’t know where it comes from, 
Don’t know where it goes, 
But let it blow over me.
 
Oh, sweet wind 
Come and blow over me.
 
There’s a rain a pouring 
Showers from above. 
Mercy drops are coming 
Mercy drops of love. 
Turn your face to heaven 
Let the water pour 
Well let it pour over me.
 
Oh, sweet rain 
Come and blow pour over me.
 
There’s a fire burning 
Falling from the sky. 
Awesome tongues of fire 
Consuming you and I. 
Can You feel it burning 
Burn the sacrifice 
Well let it burn over me. 
 
Oh, sweet wind fire 
Come and blow burn over me.
