I stand to praise You, 
But I fall on my knees 
My spirit’s so hungry 
But my flesh is so weak. 

Light the fire         (Light the fire) 
In my soul.   (In my weary soul)  
Fan the flame (Fan the flame) 
Make me whole. (Make my spirit whole) 

Lord You know   (Lord You know) 
Where I’ve been. (where I’ve been) 
So light the fire in my heart again. 

I feel Your arms around me, 
As the power of Your healing begin. 
You breathe new life right through me, 
Like a mighty rushing wind.
