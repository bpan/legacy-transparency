I will worship You (echo).  
Worship and adore You. 
I will worship You (echo).  
Lay my life before You. 

I’ll bow my head before Your glory. 
Worship at Your feet. 
And I’ll declare that You are worthy 
I’ll set my eyes on You alone and… 
 
I will lift my hands to You 
Saying “Father I love You. 
Father I need You.”  

I will lift my voice and sing 
I will sing of Your glory, 
The glory of my King.
