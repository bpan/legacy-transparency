In this dry and barren land 
Among a people turned away 
We will stand apart and seek Your name 
We will arise 

We will stand against the grain 
We will walk through the storm 
And not be weathered by rain 
We will stand 

A holy nation set apart 
A royal priesthood seeking purity of heart 
We will stand, we will stand 
In this dry and barren land
