We believe in God the Father 
Maker of the universe. 
And in Christ the Son, our Savior, 
Come to us by virgin birth. 

We believe He died to save us, 
Bore our sins, was crucified; 
Then, from death, He rose victorious 
Ascended to the Fatherâ€™s side.
 
Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all; 
Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all; 
Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all; 
Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all; 
Lord of all.
 
We believe He sends His Spirit 
On His church with gifts of power. 
God, His Word of truth affirming, 
Sends us to the nations now.
 
He will come again in glory 
Judge the living and the dead; 
Every knee shall bow before Him, 
Then must every tongue confess.
