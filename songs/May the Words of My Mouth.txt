May the words of my mouth, and the thoughts of my heart 
Bless Your name, bless Your name, Jesus. 
And the deeds of the day, and the truth in my way, 
Speak of You, speak of You, Jesus. 
 
For this is what I’m glad to do, 
It’s time to live a life of love that pleases You. 
And I will give my all to You, 
Surrender everything I have and follow You, 
I’ll follow You.
 
Lord will You be my vision, Lord will You be my Guide? 
Be my hope, be my life, and the Way. 
And I’ll look not for riches, nor praises on the earth, 
Only You’ll be the first of my heart.
 
I will follow, I will follow You. 
I will follow, I will follow You. 
I will follow, I will follow You. 
I will follow, I will follow You.
