I love to live in Your house, O Lord.  
I love to sit here at Your feet. 
And let Your Words be the food I eat, 
The food I eat. 

I love to live in Your house, O Lord.  
To dine at the table with my King.  
And give to You the praise I bring, 
The praise I bring. 

For here in Your house, 
I find Your embrace. 
You set on my head, 
A garland of grace. 

When I lift my hands, 
You fill me with more. 
Oh I long to live, I long to live, 
In the house of the Lord.
