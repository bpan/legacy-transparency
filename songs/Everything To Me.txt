Jesus Christ, King of Glory, 
Lord of all we praise You.  
Forever Your name will be praised, 
In heaven and earth always. 

Jesus Christ, You’re my Savior, 
And I will run after You 
For You are the Son of God 
And King over all the world. 

And I will never stop praising You, 
For all the things You’ve done for me 
And I’ll be Yours forever, 
Jesus you’re everything to me 

Jesus You’re everything to me, 
Jesus You’re everything to me (2x)
