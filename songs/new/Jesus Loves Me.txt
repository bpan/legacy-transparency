Jesus loves me, this I know
For the Bible tells me so
Little ones to Him belong
We are weak, but He is strong.

Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
The Bible tells me so

Jesus loves me, see His grace
On the cross He took my place
There He suffered and He died
That I might be glorified.

Jesus loves me, Godâ€™s own Son
Over sin the victory won
When I die, saved by His grace
I shall see Him face to face
