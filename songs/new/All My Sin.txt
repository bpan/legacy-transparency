All my sin (all my sin)
Poured on Him (poured on Him)
I’ve been washed in the blood He shed
Took my place (took my place)
My disgrace, (my disgrace)
I’ve been washed in the blood He shed

I am clean, I am clean
I’ve been washed in the blood He shed
Free at last, from my past
I’ve been washed in the blood He shed
