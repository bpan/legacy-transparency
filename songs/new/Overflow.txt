Here I bring my stains and crowns,
Gentle river wash me now.
Your love is deeper than I know,
Your waves higher than I can go
Lead me in Your holiness, I will follow, I confess
Glory is the song I sing
Your life is living me

Where would I be without You, without You?
Where would I be without You?

I will bow before the cross,
Cherish my redeemer’s cost,
There is nothing I can do,
Than only stand amazed by you.
Your mercy new with everyday,
Wrapped up in Your arms of grace
Nothing more, You’re all I need,
Your life is living me
