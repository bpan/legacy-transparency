Awaken the song in me 
Rouse my heart to love 
Refreshing Your song in me 
Draw me now to love. 
Renew passion, restore vision 
Awaken the song in me. 
 
To sing to You, to dance with You 
It is good to be near You my God 
To sing to You, to dance with You 
It is good to be near You my God. 
 
I will sing to You
