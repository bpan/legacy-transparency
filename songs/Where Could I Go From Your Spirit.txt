Where could I go from Your Spirit? 
How could I hide from Your eyes? 
Why would I wander away from You 
Knowing that You are so wise? 

If I take the wings of the morning, 
And dwell in the depths of the sea, 
Even the darkness hides nothing from You, 
And with Your hand You will lead me.
 
For You had knit me together 
Even before I was born. 
I will confess You and praise You, 
For You are my wonderful Lord.
