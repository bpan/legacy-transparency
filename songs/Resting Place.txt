Heaven is My throne 
And earth is My footstool. 
Where is the house you will build for Me? 
Whom of you will hear the cry of My heart? 
Where will my resting place be? 

Here Oh Lord, 
Have I prepared for You a home, 
Long have I desired for You to dwell. 
Here Oh Lord, 
Have I prepared for You a resting place 
Here Oh Lord, I wait for You alone.
