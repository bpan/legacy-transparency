I’m so secure, You’re here with me.  
You stay the same. 
You’re love remains, here in my heart. 

So close, I believe 
You’re holding me now. 
In Your hands I belong, 
You’ll never let me go. (2x) 

You gave Your life, 
You’re endless love.  
You set me free. 
And show the way, now I am found. 

All along, You were besides me, 
Even when I couldn’t tell. 
Through the years, 
You show me more of You, 
More of You.
