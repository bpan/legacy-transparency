Sometimes his eyes were gentle and filled with laughter 
And sometimes they cried 
Sometimes there was a fire of holy anger 
In Jesus' eyes 
But the eyes that saw hope in the hopeless 
That saw through the fault to the need 
Are the same eyes that look down from heaven 
Into the deepest part of you and me 

And his eyes are always upon us 
His eyes never close in sleep 
And no matter where you go you will always be in his eyes 

Sometimes his voice comes calling like rolling thunder 
Or like driving rain 
And sometimes his voice is quiet and we start to wonder 
If he knows our pain 
But he who spoke peace to the water 
Cares more for our heart than the waves 
And the voice that once said  you're forgiven 
Still says  you're forgiven  today,   today 

Sometimes I look above me when the stars are shining 
And I feel so small 
How could the God of heaven and all creation 
Know I'm here at all 
But then in the silence he whispers 
My child I created you too 
And you're my most precious creation 
I even gave my Son for you
