How lovely on the mountains are the feet of him 
Who brings good news, good news. 
Announcing peace, 
Proclaiming news of happiness, 
Our God reigns, our God reigns.   

Our God reigns, our God reigns. 
Our God reigns, our God reigns! 

He had no stately form, He had no majesty 
That we should be drawn to Him. 
He was despised 
And we took no account of Him, 
Yet now He reigns, now He reigns; 
Now He reigns with the most high. 

Out from the tomb 
He came with grace and majesty 
He is alive, He is alive. God loves us so, 
See here His hands His feet, His side, 
Yes we know, He is alive.
