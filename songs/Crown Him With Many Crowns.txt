Crown Him with many crowns, 
The Lamb upon His throne 
Hark! How the heavenly anthem drowns
All music but its own. 
Awake my soul and sing, 
Of Him who died for me. 
And hail Him as thy matchless King 
Through all eternity. 

Crown Him the Son of God, 
Before the worlds began, 
And ye who tread where He hath trod, 
Crown Him the Son of Man 
Who every grief hath known 
That wrings the human breast, 
And takes and bears them for His own, 
That all in Him may rest. 

Crown Him the Lord of life, 
Who triumphed over the grave, 
And rose victorious in the strife 
For those He came to save. 
His glories now we sing, 
Who died, and rose on high, 
Who died eternal life to bring, 
And lives that death may die. 

Crown Him the Lord of love, 
Behold His hands and side, 
Those wounds, yet visible above, 
In beauty glorified. 
No angel in the sky can fully bear that sight, 
But downward bends his burning eye 
At mysteries so bright. 

Crown Him the Lord of Heaven, 
Enthroned in worlds above, 
Crown Him the King to Whom is given 
The wondrous name of Love. 
Crown Him with many crowns, 
As thrones before Him fall; 
Crown Him, ye kings, with many crowns, 
For He is King of all. 

Crown Him the Lord of lords, 
Aho over all doth reign, 
Who once on earth, the incarnate Word, 
For ransomed sinners slain, 
Now lives in realms of light, 
Where saints with angels sing 
Their songs before Him day and night, 
Their God, Redeemer, King.
