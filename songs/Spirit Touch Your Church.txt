And Lord we need Your grace and mercy 
We need to pray like never before. 
We need the power of Your Holy Spirit 
To open heaven’s door. 
 
Spirit touch Your Church, stir the hearts of men. 
Revive us Lord with Your passion once again. 
I want to care for others like Jesus cares for me. 
Let Your rain fall upon me, let Your rain fall upon me.
 
And Lord we humbly come before You, 
We don’t deserve of You what we ask, 
But we yearn to see Your glory 
Restore this dying land.
