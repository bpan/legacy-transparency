Here I stand, in the blessing 
Of the Father’s love. 
Washed in blood, sweet forgiveness 
For a life undone. 
 
Knowing that Your love is all I need 
All I need…to get by. 
Knowing that Your hand is over me 
Over me…all my life. 
My Father, I love You. 
My Father, I love You. 
My Father, I love You.
 
Here I stand, in the blessings 
Of a million years. 
Washed within, filled with comfort 
For a million tears.
