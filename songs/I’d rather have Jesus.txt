I’d rather have Jesus, 
than silver or gold.
I’d rather have Jesus, 
than riches untold.
I’d rather have Jesus, 
than houses or lands.
I’d rather have Jesus, 
by His nail-pierce hands.

Than to be the king of a vast domain,
Or held in sin’s dread sway.
I’d rather have Jesus than anything.
This world affords today.

I’d rather have Jesus, 
than man’s applause.
I’d rather have Jesus, 
to His dear cause.
I’d rather have Jesus, 
than world-wide fame.
I’d rather be true to His holy name.
