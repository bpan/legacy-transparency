When it’s all said and done 
I will breathe the breath of worship 
When my journey is through 
I will bend my knee in awe 
When the song fills my soul joining voice with all creation 
I will sing when it’s all said and done 
 
When it’s all said and done 
And my questions have been answered 
When the chords fade away 
From the song of grief and pain 
When the pull at this flesh has no power in my tomorrow’s 
I will sing when it’s all said and done
 
When it’s all said and done 
And my final step is taken 
When I stand face to face 
With the One I long to know 
When my heart understands with convicting revelation 
I will bow when it’s all said and done
