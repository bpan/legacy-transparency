I love You, Lord, and I lift my voice 
To worship You, O my soul, rejoice.  
Take joy my King, in what You hear. 
May it be a sweet, sweet sound in Your ear. 

I love You Lord, and I want to live.  
According to each command You give.  
Take joy, my King, in what I do. 
Make my life a sweet offering unto You.
