Manifest Your love in me, 
By Your presence let me see. 
Fatherless I’ll never be, 
When I am with You. 

Bring the love that casts out fear, 
Melodies I long to hear. 
Only You can dry my tears 
When I am with You. 

Oh Lord, when I am with You it’s easy. 
I can’t deny Your love 
And my heart is laid open before You.  
When I am with You, I’m lost in love. 

I am lost within Your love, 
When Your voice comes like a dove. 
I can feel Your gentle touch 
When I am with You.  

When I am with You I know, 
You will stay and never go.  
All Your love You freely show, 
When I am with You.
