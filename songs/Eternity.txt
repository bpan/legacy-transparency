I will be Yours, You will be mine, 
Together in eternity. 
Our hearts of love, will be entwined, 
Together in eternity, forever in eternity. 

No more tears of pain in our eyes. 
No more fear or shame, 
For we will be with You. 
Yes we will be with You. 

We will worship, 
We will worship You, forever.
