The view is clear from where I stand, 
I can see the imprints of God’s hand. 
From who I was to who I’ll be 
His love and grace has delivered me. 
Guiding me, guarding me, 
Leading me, loving me. 
 
Isn’t He good?  Isn’t He good? 
Hasn’t He done all He said He would. 
All that we have, all that we are 
Comes from above.
 
Isn’t He good?  Isn’t He good? 
He met the need like only He could. 
Faithful and true, to me and you. 
Isn’t He good?
 
The smallest voice, the biggest fear, 
The loving heart of the Father hears. 
And answers each and every prayer 
Of every child who’s within His care. 
Blessing us, building us, 
Feeding us, filling us.
