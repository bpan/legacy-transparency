How do you explain?  
How do you describe? 
A love that goes from east to west, 
And runs as deep as it is wide? 

You know all our hopes. 
Lord, you know all our fears 
And words cannot express the love we feel, 
But we long for You to hear. 

So listen to our hearts,    (O Lord, please listen) 
Hear our spirits sing      (and hear us singing) 
A song of praise that flows (A simple song of praise) 
From those You have redeemed (From those you have redeemed) 

And we will use the words we know 
To tell you what an awesome God you are 
But words are not enough, 
To tell You of our love 
So listen to our hearts… 

If words could fall like rain 
From these lips of mine 
And if I had a thousand years, 
I would still run out of time. 

So if You’ll listen to my heart, 
Every beat would say 
“Thank You for the life, 
Thank You for the truth, 
Thank You for the way…”
