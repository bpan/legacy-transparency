Father I come to You, lifting up my hands. 
In the Name of Jesus, by Your grace I stand. 
Just because You love me and I love Your Son 
I know Your favor,  unending love. 
 
I receive Your favor, Your unending love. 
Not because I’ve earned it, not for what I’ve done. 
Just because You love me and I love Your Son 
I know Your favor,  unending love.
 
Unending love, Your unending love. 
Unending love, Your unending love.
 
It’s the presence of Your kingdom 
As Your glory fills this place 
And I see how much You love me 
As I look into Your face. 
Nothing could be better, there’s nothing I would trade 
For Your favor, unending love.
