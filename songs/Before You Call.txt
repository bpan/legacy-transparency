Come to Me, My people come,
Thereâ€™s no need to be afraid of your Father
When I see you I will run, I will be there, 
I will be there. 

Before you call I will answer you,
While you still speak, I will hear.
My ears are turned to the cry of My chosen ones.

In my love, You can rest in Me, 
For you are My very own,
So hold onto the hope you have, 
That I will draw you to Myself,
For I will never leave you alone. 

I will not forget You, 
I gather My lambs in My arms,
So I will comfort You 
And carry You close to my heart.
