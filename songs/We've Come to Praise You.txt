Lord, we come into this place tonight. 
None of us is worthy; none is right. 
Take a hold of our wandering hearts, 

There is no other place to start, 
What we need only You can bring, 
Meet us as we sing…

We come to praise You. 
We come to praise You. 
You are God,  You are God, 
You are God,  You are God, 
You are holy,  You are Holy, 
You are holy,  You are Holy.

We come to praise You. 
We come to praise You.
