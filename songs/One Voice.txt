Father we ask of You this day 
To come and heal our land. 
Knit our hearts together 
That Your glory may be seen in us. 
Then the world will know that Jesus Christ is Lord. 
 
Let us be one voice that glorifies Your name. 
Let us be one voice declaring that You reign. 
Let us be one voice in love and harmony; 
And we pray, O God, grant us unity.
 
Now is the time for you and I 
To join our hearts in praise, 
That the name of Jesus 
Will be lifted high above the earth, 
Then the world will know that Jesus Christ is Lord.
