Many men will drink the rain, 
And turn and thank the clouds. 
Many men will hear You speak, 
But they will never turn around 

But I will not forget You, Youâ€™re my God, my King 
With a thankful heart, I bring my offering 
And my sacrifice is, not what You can give 
But what I alone can give to You
 
A grateful heart I give 
A thankful prayer I pray 
A wild dance I dance before You 
A loud song I sing 
A huge bell I ring 
A life of praise I live before You
 
Many men will pour their gold, 
And serve a thing that shines. 
Many men will read Your words, 
But they will never change their minds
