One thing I know that I have found
Through all the troubles that surround
You are the rock that never fails
You never fail

One thing I know that I believe
Through every blessing I receive
You are the only one that stays
You always stay

You never change
Youâ€™re still the same
You are the Everlasting God
You will remain
After the day is gone
And things of earth have passed
Everlasting God 

Everlasting, everlasting, everlasting God
Everlasting, everlasting, everlasting God
