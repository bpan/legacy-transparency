The spirit of the sovereign Lord is upon us 
Because He has anointed us 
To preach good news. 
 
He has sent you to the poor (This is the year.)
To bind up the broken hearted (This is the day.)
To bring freedom to the captives (This is the year.)
And to release the ones in darkness.
 
This is the year of the favor of the Lord. 
This is the day of the vengeance of our God. 
 
He will comfort all who mourn (This is the year.)
He will provide for those who grieve (This is the day.)
He will pour out the oil of gladness (This is the year.)
Instead of mourning you will praise.
