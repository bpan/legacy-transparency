We are His people, He gives us music to sing. 
There is a sound now, 
Like the sound of the Lord when His enemies flee. 
 
But there is a cry in our hearts, 
Like when deep calls unto the deep. 
For Your breath of deliverance 
To breathe on the music we so desperately need.
 
But without Your power 
All we have are these simple songs. 
If Youâ€™d step down from heaven, 
Then the gates of hell would surely fall.
 
Shout to the Lord, shout to the Lord, 
Shout to the Lord of hosts. 
Shout to the Lord, shout to the Lord, 
Shout to the Lord of hosts.
 
And it breaks the heavy yoke, breaks the heavy yoke, 
When you shout, you shout to the Lord. 
And it breaks the heavy yoke, breaks the heavy yoke, 
When you shout, you shout to the Lord.
