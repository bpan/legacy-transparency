Every breath that I take says I love You. 
Every beat of my heart says I’m Yours. 
Every step that I take says I need You. 
And I will bless Your holy name. 

You are my Redeemer. 
You’re the reason that I live. 
Yes, and You are my salvation, 
And I will bless Your holy name. 

Every day that goes by shows Your mercy. 
Every gift that you give shows You care. 
Every song that I sing says You’re worthy. 
And I will bless Your holy name.
