Immortal, invisible, God only wise, 
In light inaccessible hid from our eyes, 
Most blessed, most glorious, 
The Ancient of Days, 
Almighty, victorious, 
Thy great Name we praise. 

Great Father of glory, pure Father of light, 
Thine angels adore Thee, 
All veiling their sight; 
But of all Thy rich graces 
This grace, Lord, impart 
Take the veil from our faces, 
The vile from our heart. 

All praise we would render; O help us to see 
â€™Tis only the splendor of light hideth Thee, 
And so let Thy glory, almighty, impart, 
Through Christ in His story, 
Thy Christ to the heart.
