Hungry, I come to You
For I know, You satisfy. 
I am empty, but I know Your love, 
Does not run dry. 

And so I wait, for You.  
So I wait for You.  
I’m falling on my knees, 
Offering all of me. 
Jesus, You’re all this heart is living for. 

Broken I run to You, 
For Your arms are open wide. 
I am weary but I know 
Your touch restores my life.
