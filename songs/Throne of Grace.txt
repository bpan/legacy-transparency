Oh my Lord, You are so kind 
Oh my Lord, You are so kind 
Morning to morning, day to day 
You reveal Your righteous ways 
 
It’s Your kindness that leads to repentance 
It’s Your blood that brings forgiveness 
It’s Your mercy that leads me here 
To Your throne of grace.
 
In Your kindness I find repentance 
In Your blood I find forgiveness 
In Your mercy I find myself 
At Your throne of grace 
Your throne of grace.
