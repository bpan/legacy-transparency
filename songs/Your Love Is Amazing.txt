Your love is amazing,
Steady and unchanging 
Your love is a mountain,
Firm beneath my feet

Your love is a mystery,
How you gently lift me 
When I am surrounded,
Your love carries me 

Hallelujah! 
Hallelujah! 
Hallelujah! 
Your love makes me sing! 

Your love is surprising,
I can feel it rising 
All the joy thatâ€™s growing,
Deep inside of me

Every time I see You, 
All your goodness shines through 
And I can feel this God song,
Rising up in me
