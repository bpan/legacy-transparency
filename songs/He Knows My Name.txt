I have a Maker 
He formed my heart 
Before even time began 
My life was in His hands 

He knows my name 
He knows my every thought 
He sees each tear that falls 
And hears me when I call 

I have a Father 
He calls me His own 
He’ll never leave me 
No matter where I go 

He knows my name 
He knows my every thought 
He sees each tear that falls 
And hears me when I call 

You are my Maker 
You formed my heart 
Before even time began 
My life was in Your hands 

You know my name 
You know my every thought 
You see each tear that falls 
And hear me when I call 

You are my Father 
You call me His own 
You’ll never leave me 
No matter where I go 

You know my name 
You know my every thought 
You see each tear that falls 
And hear me when I call
