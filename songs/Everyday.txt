I’ve got to say Lord, 
It’s you who gave me life and 
I can’t explain just how 
Much you mean to me, now that 

You have saved me Lord 
I give all that I am to You 
That everyday I can 
Be a light that shines Your name 

Everyday Lord I’ll learn to stand upon Your Word 
And I pray that I, 
That I might come to know You more 

That you would guide me in every step I take 
That everyday I can 
Be a light unto the world 

Everyday, it’s You I’ll live for 
Everyday, I’ll follow after You 
Everyday, I’ll walk with You my Lord 

It’s You I live for every day 
It’s You I live for every day 
It’s You I live for every day
