Jesus comes He comes in power (echo) 
Pour out Your Spirit like a shower (echo)   
Jesus comes He comes in power (echo) 
Pour out Your Spirit like a shower (echo)  

Give us freedom and joy 
In Your presence, Lord 
In Your presence we’re free, 
Oh let us shout and dance, 
And lift up our hands, 
And sing ‘cause we are free. 

Turn my mourning into dancing (echo) 
And turn my weeping into laughing (echo)   
Turn my mourning into dancing (echo) 
And turn my weeping into laughing (echo)   

When He comes, He comes in power 
When He comes, He comes in power 
Jesus come, come in power.  
Oh Lord, come in power.
