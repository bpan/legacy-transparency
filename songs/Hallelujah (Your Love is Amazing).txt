Your love is amazing, steady and unchanging 
Your love is a mountain, firm beneath my feet. 
Your love is a mystery, how you gently lift me, 
When I am surrounded, Your love carries me. 
 
Hallelujah, hallelujah 
Hallelujah, Your love makes me sing. 
Hallelujah, hallelujah 
Hallelujah, Your love makes me sing.
 
Your love is surprising, I can feel it rising 
All the joy thatâ€™s growing deep inside of me. 
Every time I see You,
All Your goodness shines through 
And I can feel this God song, rising up in me.
 
Yes, you make me sing. 
Lord You make me sing, sing, sing. 
How You make me sing.
