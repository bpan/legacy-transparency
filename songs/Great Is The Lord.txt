Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise. 
In the city of our God the holy place, 
The joy of the whole earth (echo) 

Great is the Lord 
In whom we have the victory 
He aids us against the enemy.  
We bow down on our knees (echo) 

And Lord we want to lift Your name on high 
And Lord we want to thank You, 
For the work Youâ€™ve done in our lives. 

And Lord we trust in Your unfailing love. 
For You alone are God eternal, 
Throughout earth and heaven above.
