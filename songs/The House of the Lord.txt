We have come to celebrate 
We have come to sing of Your great 
Power and the glory of Your Name. 
You have set the captives free 
You have made my blind eyes see 
To the poor You have proclaimed good news. 
 
In the house of the Lord 
Where Your children come to dance and sing 
In the house of the Lord 
We rejoice in all the things You’ve done.
 
We have come to worship You 
To give thanks and praise to You 
Knowing that You’ve only just begun. 
You have touched us by Your grace 
Lord we long to see Your face 
To be with You for all eternity.
