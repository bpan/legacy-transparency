Lord, I long to see You glorified, 
In everything I do. 
All my heartfelt dreams I put aside 
To see Your Spirit move 
With power in my life. 

Jesus, Lord of all eternity, 
Your children rise in faith. 
All the earth displays Your glory 
And each word You speak 
Brings life to all who hear.

Lord of all,   
All of creation sings Your praise.
In heaven and earth, 
Lord, we stand
With hearts open wide. 
Be exalted.
