Lift up your gaze be lifted up 
Tell everyone how great the love 
The love come down from heaven's gate 
To kiss the earth with hope and grace
Sing 

Who is this King of Glory? 
The Lord, strong and mighty 

Lift up your hands be lifted up 
Let the redeemed declare the love 
We bow down at heaven's gate 
To kiss the feet of hope and grace 

There is one God He is Holy 
There is one Lord over everything
There is one King He is Jesus 
King of glory strong and mighty 

You are the King of Glory 
The Lord, strong and mighty
