We have heard the thunder 
And we have seen the storm 
Echoes of Your Kingdom coming 
And rumors of our home 

Where one day we will 
Stand before You Lord 
Our altogether beautiful reward 

And we will give You glory 
Bring You honor 
King above all Kings 
You deserve our everything 

We will lift our voices 
With Your praises 
Jesus You are our King 

Though now we walk in the darkness 
Though now we see in part 
Right now we’re warmed 
By the burning flames 
Of the fire in our hearts 

You’ve promised You will 
Lead us to Your throne 
Where we will worship You 
And You alone 

We will give You glory 
We will give You glory 
We will give You glory 
We will give You glory 
Glory 

Jesus You are 
Jesus You are 
Jesus You are 
Our King
