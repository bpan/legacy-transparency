Lord I groan, Lord I kneel, 
I’m crying out for something real. 
Because I know, deep in my soul, 
There must be more. 

Lord I’m tired, yes I’m weak, 
I need Your power to work in me. 
‘Cause I can’t let go, I keep hanging on, 
There must be more. 

There must be more 
There must be more  
River flow, fire burn. 
River flow, fire burn.  
Holy Spirit, breathe on me. 
Holy Spirit, breathe on me.
