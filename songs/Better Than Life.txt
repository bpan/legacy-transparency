Better than the riches of this world 
Better than the sound 
Of my friends’ voices 
Better than the biggest dreams 
Of my heart 
And that’s just the start 

Better than getting what I say I need 
Better than living 
The life that I want to 
Better than the love 
Anyone could give 
Your love is

You hold me now in Your arms 
And never let me go

You oh Lord make the sun shine
And the moon light in the night sky 
You give me 
Breath and all Your love 
I give my heart to You because

I can’t stop falling in love with You 
I’ll never stop falling in love with You
