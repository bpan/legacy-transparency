Wonderful, merciful Savior, 
Precious redeemer and friend 
Who would have thought that a lamb could 
Rescue the souls of men,  
Oh You rescue the souls of men 

Counselor, comforter, keeper 
Spirit we long to embrace 
You offer hope when our hearts have 
Hopelessly lost the way,  
Oh we hopelessly lost the way 

You are the One that we praise, 
You are the One we adore 
You give the healing and grace our 
Hearts always hunger for, 
Oh our hearts always hunger for 

Almighty, infinite Father 
Faithfully loving Your own 
Here in our weakness You find us 
Falling before Your throne, 
Oh we're falling before Your throne
