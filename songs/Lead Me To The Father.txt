My heart waits with expectation, 
A longing for love insatiable desire. 
Jesus lead me to the Fatherâ€™s arms, 
His comforting words build hope to carry on. 

How can I live without 
Your gentle soothing voice. 
Where can I go to know 
The fruits of love and joy. 

Lead me to the Father 
Lead me to the Father 

Bring my heart to the point of least resistance 
A place of simple trust, And one of simple faith 
Only You can take me to His home 
Where we will be united his promises fulfilled
