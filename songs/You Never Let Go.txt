Even though I walk
Through valley of the shadow of death 
Your perfect love is casting out fear 

Even when I’m caught
In the middle of the storms of this life 
I won’t turn back, 
I know You are near
 
And I will fear no evil, 
For my God is with me. 
And if my God is with me, 
Whom, then, shall I fear? 
Whom, then, shall I fear?
 
Oh no, You never let go 
Through the calm 
And through the storm
 
Oh no, You never let go 
In every high and every low 
Oh no, You never let go 
Lord, You never let go of me
 
And I can see a light that is coming 
For the heart that holds on 
A glorious light beyond all compare 
And there will be an end to these troubles,
But until that day comes 
We’ll live to know You’re here on the earth
 
Yes, I can see a light that is coming 
For the heart that holds on 
And there will be an end to these troubles,
But until that day comes 
Still I will praise You 
Still I will praise You
