There is a place that I know, 
Where I need more often to go. 
A place of amazing, comfort and rest. 

Where a smile is never rare, 
And Your love is as free as the air. 
And I lack for nothing,
When I can see the love in Your eyes. 
And know that it’s all for me. 

I fear nothing at all, 
When I’m safe in the arms of my Father. 
And if ever I fall, 
I take comfort in knowing that You are there.
