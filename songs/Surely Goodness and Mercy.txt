You prepare a table before me, 
In the presence of my enemies. 
You anoint my head with oil, 
And my cup, it overflows. 

With love, peace, and joy. 
With love, peace, and joy. 
 
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me 
All the days of my life, 
All the days of my life. 
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord 
Forever, forever, forever 
Amen.
