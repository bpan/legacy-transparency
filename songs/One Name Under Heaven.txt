One name under Heaven  
Whereby we must be saved.  (2x). 

Forgiven of my sins, 
Baptized in the water 
Filled with the Holy Ghost, 
And washed in the blood of the Lamb. (2x) 

Free, really free my friend  
Freed, by the blood of the Lamb.  (2x) 

God’s gonna move this place.  
God’s gonna move this place 
God’s gonna turn this world upside-down.  
(2x)
