Come on everybody sing a song of joy 
Let everybody listen to a happy song. 
Come on everybody sing a song of joy 
Let everybody listen to the world around. 
 
Joy like the sunshine, 
Joy like the rain. 
Joy like the gold mine, 
 
Come on everybody sing it once again. (yell) 
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia 
Alleluia, Alleluia 
All because of Jesus.
