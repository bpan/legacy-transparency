Your eye is on the sparrow 
And Your hand it comforts me. 
From the ends of the earth 
To the depths of my heart, 
Let Your mercy and grace be seen. 

You call me to Your purpose, 
As angels understand. 
For Your glory, may You draw all me, 
As Your love and grace demands. 

And I will run to You, 
To Your words of truth. 
Not by might, not by power, 
But by the Spirit of God. 

Yes, I will run the race, 
â€˜Till I see Your face. 
Oh, let me live 
In the glory of Your grace.
