Great is the Lord God Almighty, 
Great is the Lord on high 
The train of His robe fills the temple, 
And we cry out highest praise 
Glory to the risen King, glory to the Son, 
Glorious Son 

Lift up your heads, open the doors, 
Let the King of glory come in 
And forever be our God

Lift up your heads, open the doors, 
Let the King of glory come in 
And forever be our God 

Holy is the Lord God Almighty, 
Holy is the Lord on high 
Let all the earth bow before You, 
And crown You Lord of all
