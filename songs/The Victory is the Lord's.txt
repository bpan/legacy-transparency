The victory is the Lord’s. 
The victory is the Lord’s. 
We’ve just begun to fight, oh. 
We’ve just begun to fight, oh. 
 
And when I get discouraged 
Having done all then I stand. 
He gave us weapons to fight and the spirit of might 
I feel the power the word of the Lord.
 
Where is the Lord, God of Elijah? 
Elohim, my redeemer and my friend. 
Any weapon formed against me will not prosper. 
His eyes are a flame of fire, 
And His will is my desire.
