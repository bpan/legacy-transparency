There is no rock like our God. 
There is no rock like our God. 
Precious cornerstone 
I stand on You alone 
There is no rock like our God. 
 
Neither life nor death 
Nor any other power 
Can keep me from 
The love of Christ my Lord. 
Nothing in this world 
Can keep His love from me. 
There is no rock like our God.
