Great and marvelous are thy works, 
Lord God Almighty. 
Just and true are thy ways oh Lord, 
You are the King of saints. 
 
Who shall not fear Thee? 
Who shall not glorify thy name oh Lord? 
Only Thou art holy, 
All the nations shall come and worship before thee.
 
For thy judgments are made manifest. 
For thy judgments are made manifest.
 
Hallelujah,  hallelujah 
Hallelujah to the King of saints. 
Glory hallelujah,  glory hallelujah 
Glory hallelujah to the King of saints.
