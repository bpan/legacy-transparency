I once was fatherless
A stranger with no hope
Your kindness wakened me
Wakened me from my sleep

Your love it beckons deeply
A call to come and die
By grace now I will come
And take this life, take Your life

Sin has lost its power,
Death has lost its sting
From the grave You’ve risen victoriously

Into marvelous light I’m running
Out of darkness, out of shame,
By the cross, you are the truth,
You are the life, you are the way

My dead heart is now beating
My deepest stains now clean
Your breath fills up my lungs
Now I’m free, now I’m free
