We will give ourselves no rest
‘Til Your kingdom comes on earth
We’ve positioned watchmen on the walls

Now our prayers will flow like tears
For You’ve shared Your heart with us
God of Heaven, on our knees we fall

Come down, in power, 
Reveal Your heart again
Come hear, our cries, 
The tears that plead for rain

We’re knockin’, knockin’on the door of Heaven
We’re cryin’, cryin’ for this generation
We’re prayin’ for Your name to be known
In all of the Earth

We’re watchin’, watchin’ on the walls to see You
We’re lookin’, lookin’ for a time of breakthrough
We’re prayin’ for Your Word to bear fruit
In all of the earth, in all of the earth.
