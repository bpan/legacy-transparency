O Lord, our Lord 
How majestic is Your name. 
Your words are true 
Your compassion does not change. 

All Your promises are precious 
Reviving our faith 
Everyone of them will be fulfilled one day.
 
Oh, all Your promises are “Yes” and “Amen” in Jesus 
Your promises are true. 
All Your promises are “Yes” and “Amen” Lord Jesus 
We’ll keep running after You.
 
We will run 
We’ll run and not grow weary. 
We will rise upon the eagle’s wings. 
In the presence of the Lord our spirits will soar 
        ‘Til we one day gaze upon our King.
 
But my foot had almost slipped 
O Lord I almost lost my way 
‘Til I entered the house of the Lord 
And heard Your sweet Spirit say.
