O Sacred king, O Holy King 
How can I honor You rightly 
Honor that’s fit for Your name

O Sacred Friend, O Holy Friend 
I don’t take what You did lightly 
Friendship instead of disgrace

For it’s the mystery of the universe 
You’re the God of holiness 
Yet You welcome souls like me 
And with the blessing of your Father’s heart 
You disciplined the ones you love 
There’s kindness in Your majesty

Jesus those who recognize Your power 
Know just how wonderful You are 
When You draw near
