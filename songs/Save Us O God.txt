We confess the sins of our nation, 
And Lord we are guilty of 
A prayerless life.  

We’ve turned away our hearts from your laws.  
And have taken for granted 
Your unchanging grace.  

Turn away, this curse from our country, 
We say that we’ve robbed You, 
And our storehouses are bare.  

Open wide the floodgates from heaven, 
Rebuke the devourer 
So we May not be destroyed. 

You said that if we humble ourselves, 
And begin to pray. 
You would heal our barren land 
And cleanse us with Your rain. 

Don’t pass us by, 
Let this be the generation, 
Lord, that lifts up your name to all the world.  

Save us, oh God, 
Save a people for yourself, oh Lord.  
Let the fear of the Lord be their standard 

Save us, oh God, 
Cleanse us from our unfaithfulness, 
Let the place where we live 
Be called a house of prayer.
