When I think about the Lord, 
How He saved me, how He raised me 
How He filled me with the Holy Ghost,  
How He healed me to the uttermost 

When I think about the Lord, 
How he picked me up, turned me around 
How He set my feet on solid ground 

It makes me want to shout, 
Hallelujah, thank you Jesus 
Lord, you're worthy of all the glory, 
And all the honor, And all the praise
