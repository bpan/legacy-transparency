Lord we come into this place tonight 
None of us is worthy; none is right 
Take a hold of our wandering hearts 
There is no other place to start 

What we need only You can bring 
Meet us as we sing 

We come to praise You 
We come to praise You 

You are God (You are God) 
You are God (You are God) 
You are Holy (You are Holy) 
You are Holy (You are Holy)
