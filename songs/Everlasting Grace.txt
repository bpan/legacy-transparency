Never let me stray, 
From the truth of Calvary 
And let not my heart forget, 
Your sacrifice of love. 

Like an overflowing river, 
Is Your life You give to me. 
I want to remember, 
Help me remember. 

It’s Your everlasting grace, 
It’s Your never failing love. 
By the power of Your precious blood 
I am changed, I am changed. 

And I stand before Your throne, 
As one who bears Your name. 
Forgiven and redeemed 
And cleansed from all my shame. 

And the glory of Your presence 
Is the life You give to me. 
I want to remember, 
Help me remember.
