I waited 
For the Lord on high 
I waited 
And He heard my cry 

He pulled me out of my despair 
And showed me where to walk. 
From fear into security 
From quicksand to a rock

I’ll sing to let the people know 
That I have been restored. 
They will kneel and understand 
To return and trust in the Lord.

There’s a new song 
In my heart to sing. 
A new song 
Praises for my King.
