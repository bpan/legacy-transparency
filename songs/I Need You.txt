Lord, look upon my need 
I need You, I need You. 
Lord, have mercy now on me 
Forgive me, O Lord, forgive me 
And I will be clean. 
And I will be clean. 

O Lord, You are familiar with my ways, 
There is nothing hid  from You. 
O Lord, You know the number of my days 
I want to live my life for You.

Lord, have mercy now on me 
Forgive me, O Lord, forgive me 
And I will be clean.
