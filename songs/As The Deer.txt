As the deer panteth for the water 
So my soul longeth after Thee.
You alone are my heart’s desire 
And I long to worship Thee. 

You alone are my strength, my shield.
To You alone may my spirit yield.
You alone are my heart’s desire 
And I long to worship Thee. 

You’re my friend and You are my brother,
Even though You are a king.  
I want You more than any other, 
So much more than anything. 

I want you more than gold or silver,
Only you can satisfy.
You alone are the real joy giver,
And the apple of my eye.
