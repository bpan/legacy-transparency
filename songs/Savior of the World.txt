There’s a song 
That the lost one sings 
When they are found 
And move from dark into the light. 

There’s a song 
That the child redeemed 
Will sing out loud, 
And they will run into the Father’s arms.
 
They sing:  Oh Jesus, lifted up on high, 
Crucified for fallen man, 
You died and then You rose again, 
Oh Jesus, Savior of the world.
 
You’ve beaten death and given life, 
You came to set the prisoner free, 
You died cause You’re in love with me, 
Oh Jesus, Savior of the world.
