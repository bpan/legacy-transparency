Come thou fount of every blessing, 
Tune my heart to sing Thy praise. 
Streams of mercy never ceasing, 
Call for songs of loudest praise. 

Teach me some melodious sonnet, 
Sung by flaming tongues above. 
Praise the mount I'm fixed upon it, 
Mount of Thy redeeming love. 

O to grace how great a debtor, 
Daily I'm constrained to be. 
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter, 
Bind my wandering heart to Thee. 

Prone to wander, Lord I feel it.  
Prone to leave the God I love. 
Hereâ€™s my heart Lord, take and seal it, 
Seal it for Thy courts above.
