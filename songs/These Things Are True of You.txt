Unshakable, immovable,   
Faithful and true, 
Full of wisdom, strength and beauty.  
These things are true of You.  

Fearless, courageous, 
Righteousness shines through, in all You do, 
Yet Youâ€™re so humble, 
You laid down Your life.  
These things are true of You. 

And as I turn my face to You, oh Lord, 
I ask and pray 
By the power of Your love and grace. 
Make these things true of me, too.  
Make these things true of me, too. 

Patient, compassionate, 
Love flows through You 
You never give up on the hopeless ones.  
These things are true of You.  

Holy and blameless,  
You stand up for justice and truth, 
Yet You love mercy and forgiveness.  
These things are true of You
