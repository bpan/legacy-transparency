Holy are You Lord 
Our great and awesome God 
The heavens and the earth 
Declare the highest praise 

For there is none like You 
No one at all like You 
Our Lord and King, great and awesome God

The earth is Your footstool, 
The heavens Your throne 
You pour out Your mercy 
By this You have shown

That You are holy, righteous and true 
You are a great and awesome God 
You are a great and awesome God

Holy are You Lord 
Our great and awesome God 
You search the hearts of men 
To be both God and friend

For there is none like You 
No one at all like You 
Our Lord and King, great and awesome God.
