He became sin 
Who knew no sin 
That we might become His Righteousness 
He humbled himself and carried the cross 
Love so amazing 
Love so amazing 

Jesus Messiah, Name above all names 
Blessed Redeemer, Emmanuel 
The rescue for sinners 
The ransom from Heaven 
Jesus Messiah, Lord of all 

His body the bread 
His blood the wine 
Broken and poured out all for love 
The whole earth trembled 
And the veil was torn 
Love so amazing 
Love so amazing 

All our hope is in You 
All our hope is in You 
All the glory to You, God 
The light of the world
