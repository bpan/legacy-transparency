As long as the river flows, 
As long as the wind blows 
My heart belongs to You 
As long as the seasons change, 
As long as the flowers need the rain 
My heart belongs to you 

Lord I know I donâ€™t deserve the grace you give 
So I will give my heart to you that I might live 

You are my God, early in the morning will I 
Rise to meet you, rise to meet you 
You are my Lord, early in the morning will I 
Rise to meet you, rise to meet you
