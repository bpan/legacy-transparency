Lord, lead us into battle, 
Let us glorify Your name. 
Holy Spirit, You have set our hearts aflame. 
We will never be the same. 
 
Oh, how I love You Jesus. 
What a joy to sing Your praise. 
I have placed my hope in You and You alone. 
Iâ€™ve found healing in Your name.
 
Lord, fill us with a vision 
To see the church as one. 
Break our hearts, release us from our pride. 
Father, glorify Your bride.
 
Lord, teach us how to worship; 
May it never be in vain. 
Draw us into the throne room of our King. 
In Your power, rule and reign.
