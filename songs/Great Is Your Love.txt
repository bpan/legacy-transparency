I will praise You   (Great is your)
Oh Lord my God.  (love to me)
With all of my heart   (You have)
I will glorify    (delivered me)
Your name forever. 

Hear the passion of my prayer, O Lord. 
I have a desperate need to praise Your name. 
Your forgiveness and Your mercy 
Are the only way 
That I can get to You to say. 

Just to know You is to be alive. 
Your love has lifted me up from my grave. 
You have rescued me from sin, 
And I am blown away. 
Itâ€™s all that I can do to say.
