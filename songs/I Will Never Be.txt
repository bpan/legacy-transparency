I will never be, the same again.  
I can never return, I’ve closed the door.  
I will walk the path, I’ll run the race. 
And I will never be the same again. 

Fall like fire, soak like rain.  
Flow like mighty water, 
Again and again.  

Sweep away the darkness, 
Burn away the chaff and 
Let the flame burn 
To glory Your name. 

There are higher heights, 
There are deeper seas 
Whatever You need To do, Lord do in me.  
The glory of God, fills my life, 
And I will Never be the same again.
