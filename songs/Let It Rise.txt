Let the glory of the Lord, rise among us. 
Let the glory of the Lord, rise among us.            
Let the praises of the King, rise among us, 
Let it rise. 

Let the songs of the Lord, rise among us. 
Let the songs of the Lord, rise among us. 
Let the joy of the King, rise among us, 
Let it rise. 

Oh, let it rise 
Oh, let it rise
