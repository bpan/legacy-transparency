Father, I want You to hold me 
I want to rest in Your arms today. 
Father, I want You to show me 
How much You care for me, in every way. 
 
I bring all my cares,
And I lay them at Your feet. 
You are always there, 
And You love me as I am. 
Yes, You love me as I am.
 
Father, I want You to hold me 
I know I am Your child, Your own. 
Father, I know You will show me 
I feel Your arms holding me, Iâ€™m not alone.
 
I bring all my fears,
And I lay them at Your feet. 
You are always here, 
And You love me as I am. 
Yes, You love me as I am.
