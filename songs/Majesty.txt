Majesty, worship His majesty.  
Unto Jesus, be all glory, power and praise. 
Majesty, kingdom authority, 
Flows from His throne unto his own, 
His anthem raise. 

So exalt, lift up on high 
The name of Jesus. 
Magnify, come glorify 
Christ Jesus the King. 

Majesty, worship His majesty.  
Jesus who died, now glorified, 
King of all kings.
