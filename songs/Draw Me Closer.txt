Draw me closer, Lord. 
Draw me closer, dear Lord. 
So that I might touch You, 
So that I might touch You. 
Lord I want to touch You. 
 
Touch my eyes, Lord 
Touch my eyes, dear Lord. 
So that I might see You, 
So that I might see You. 
Lord I want to see You.
 
Your glory and Your love.    (3x) 
And Your majesty.
