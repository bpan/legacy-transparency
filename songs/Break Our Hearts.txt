Break our hearts, oh God, 
Break our hearts.  
Break our hearts, oh God, 
Break our hearts. 

For the sin in our lives, 
Break our hearts 
For the sin in our land, 
Break our hearts. 

We cry out, we need your help. 
Come back to our land. 
We confess, weâ€™ve lived in sin. 
Please show Your power once again
