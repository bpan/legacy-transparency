Heroes rise up, sometimes they fall 
Summertime has its rainy days 
Every mountain has its valleys 
True love has a price to pay. 
 
You never let us down, 
You never disappoint us. 
You always keep Your word, 
You always come through for us.
 
We don’t always understand Your timing 
But as we walk this world with You 
We’re finding Lord that 
You never let us down, 
You never disappoint us.
