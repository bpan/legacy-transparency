You bless my life and heal me inside 
Over and over again. 
You touched my heart and brought peace of mind 
Over and over again. 
 
And all I can say is I love You. 
And all I can say is I need You. 
And all I can say is I thank You Lord, 
For all that You’ve done in my life.
 
You’ve been so kind and patient with me 
Over and over again. 
And when I have strayed You showed me the way 
Over and over again.
