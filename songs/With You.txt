I will sing about everything You are always
I will tell the world everything You’ve done indeed 
I stand on higher ground
I was lost but now I’m here with You

My refuge, my stronghold
Always with You
Faithful One, holding on 
 I am always with You (always with You) 

The future of the world is within Your hands of love 
Love reaches me, I am in awe of You
I stand on higher ground
I was lost but now I’m here with You
