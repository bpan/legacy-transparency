May our homes be filled with dancing 
May our streets be filled with joy 
May injustice bow to Jesus, 
As the people turn and pray 

From the mountain to the valley 
Hear our praises rise to You 
From the heavens to the nations 
Hear the singing fill the air 

May our light shine in the darkness, 
As we walk before the cross 
May Your glory fill the whole earth, 
As the water over the seas 

Hallelujahâ€¦
