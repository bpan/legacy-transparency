Salvation belongs to our God, 
Who sits upon the throne.  
And unto the Lamb, 
Praise and glory, wisdom and thanks, 
Honor and power and strength. 

Be to our God, forever and ever 
Be to our God, forever and ever 
Be to our God, forever and ever 
Amen. 

And we the redeemed shall be strong 
In purpose and unity. 
Declaring aloud, praise and glory, 
Wisdom and thanks, 
Honor and power and strength.
