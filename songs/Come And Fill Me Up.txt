I can feel You flowing through me, 
Holy Spirit, come and fill me up,         
Come and fill me up. 

Love and mercy fill my senses, 
I am yearning for your presence Lord 
Come and fill me up. 

Lord, let Your mercy wash away 
All of my sins 
Fill me completely with Your love 
Once again 

I need You, I want You, 
I love Your presence 
I need You, I want You, 
I love Your presence
