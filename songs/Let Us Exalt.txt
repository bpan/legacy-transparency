At all times I will bless Him 
His praise will be in my mouth 
My soul makes its boast in the Lord. 
The humble man will hear of Him 
The afflicted will be glad 
And join with me to magnify the Lord. 
 
Let us exalt His name together, forever 
I sought the Lord 
He heard me and delivered me from my fears. 
Let us exalt His name together, forever 
Oh sing His praises 
Magnify the Lord.
 
The angel of the lord encamps 
Round those who fear His name 
To save them and deliver them from harm. 
Though lions roar with hunger 
We lack for no good thing 
No wonder, then, we praise Him with our song.
 
Come children now and hear me 
If you would see long life 
Just keep your lips from wickedness and lies. 
Do good and turn from evil 
Seek peace instead of strife 
Love righteousness and God will hear your cry.
