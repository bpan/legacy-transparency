We bow our hearts, we bend our knees 
Oh Spirit come make us humble 
We turn our eyes from evil things 
Oh Lord we cast down our idols 

So give us clean hands, 
Give us pure hearts 
Let us not lift our souls to another 

Oh God let us be, 
A generation that seeks 
Who seeks Your face, 
Oh God of Jacob
