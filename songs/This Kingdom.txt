Jesus, God’s righteousness revealed 
The Son of Man, the Son of God 
His Kingdom comes. 
Jesus, redemption’s sacrificed 
Now glorified, now justified 
His Kingdom come. 
 
And this Kingdom will know no end 
And its glory shall know no bound 
For the majesty and power 
Of this Kingdom’s King has come.
 
And this Kingdom’s reign, 
And this Kingdom’s rule, 
And this Kingdom’s power and authority 
Jesus, God’s righteousness revealed.
 
Jesus, the expression of God’s love 
The grace of God, the Word of God revealed to us. 
Jesus, God’s holiness displayed 
Now glorified, now justified, His Kingdom come.
 
Jesus, God’s righteousness revealed 
Jesus, God’s righteousness revealed.
