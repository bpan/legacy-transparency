Thank You,
Thank You for the blood that You shed, 
Standing in Your blessing
We sing these freedom songs. 

Thank You,
Thank You for the battle You won, 
Standing in Your victory
We sing salvation songs, 
We sing salvation songs. 
 
You have opened the way to the Father, 
Where before we could never have come. 
Jesus, count us as Yours now forever 
As we sing these freedom songs.
 
We sing of all You’ve done, 
We sing of all You’ve done, 
We sing of all You’ve done for us, 
Won for us, paid for us.
