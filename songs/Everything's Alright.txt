Seems like a good place to be, 
Me walkin’ with You, You walkin’ with me, 
Me feelin’ pain, and You bringin’ peace, 
And everything is alright. 

Seems like a sweet, sweet thing, 
For You to whisper to me, 
Me to call out Your name, 
Me fallin’ down, to see Your love remains, 
And everything is alright.
 
Everything’s alright, everything’s alright. 
Everything’s alright, and everything is alright. 
Everything, everything’s alright.
 
Seems like a nice thing to think of, 
Just to sit and think on Your love. 
Me feelin’ empty, You fillin’ me up, 
And everything is alright.
 
Seems like a fine thing to wait on, 
You’re love always sings a sweet song; 
Eyes on heaven, 
Hands up, my heart longs, 
Come take me home.
 
Oh Your sweet love is coming down, 
To put me up on solid ground, 
Where the cross is firm.
