The refuge for the poor,
A shelter from the storm
This is our God
He will wipe away your tears
And return your wasted years
This is our God

So call upon His Name, 
He is mighty to save
This is our God 

A father to the orphan, 
A healer to the broken‚
This is our God
And he brings peace to our madness 
And comfort in our sadness‚
This is our God 

This is/You are the one we have waited for
This is/You are the one we have waited for
This is/You are the one we have waited for
Jesus, Lord and Savior
This is our God 

A fountain for the thirsty, 
A lover for the lonely
This is our God
He brings glory to the humble 
And crowns for the faithful‚
This is our God

So call upon His Name, 
He is mighty to save‚
This is our God
