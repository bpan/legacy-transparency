Over the mountains and the sea, 
Your river runs with love for me. 
And I will open up my heart and let 
The healer set me free. 

I’m happy to be in the truth, 
And I will daily lift my hands. 
For I will always sing of 
When Your love came down. 

I could sing of Your love forever 
I could sing of Your love forever 
I could sing of Your love forever 
I could sing of Your love forever 

Oh I feel like dancing 
It’s foolishness I know 
But when the world has seen the Light 
They’ll be dancing ‘round 
Like we’re dancing now
