I live for You, all that I am, all that I do.  
My heart beats with You. 
Each day I wake I think of You. 

You are why I sing, You are why I live. 
Everything of me I place at Your feet 
You are why I love, You are why I give. 
Everything of me belongs to You. 

I live for You, You are my God.  
You are the truth. 
Youâ€™re all that I need.  
My soul longs for more of You.
