There is no other friend 
There is no other friend like You, oh Lord. 
No other brother, no other brother like You. 
 
There is no other love 
There is no other love like You, oh Lord. 
No other sweeter, no other fountain but You.
 
How long until I’m satisfied 
I must have more of You. 
For I was born in Zion 
Awakened love is crying out for You, 
It must be You.
 
And if I am healed by 
Just one touch of Your garment, Lord. 
Then how much more of Your love 
Is for me than I’m tasting, Lord. 
Draw me, take me and I will run 
Over the mountains and down  into the valleys 
I will run with You.
 
All, all my fountains are in You. 
All, all my fountains are in You.
