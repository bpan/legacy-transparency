So let us know,    
So let us press on to know the Lord. 
His going forth is 
As certain as the dawn, 
And He will come to us like the rain. 

Like the spring rain, 
Watering the earth, 
So let us press on to know the Lord. 

So let us return, 
So let us return to the Lord 
His going forth is 
As certain as the dawn, 
And He will come to us like the rain.
