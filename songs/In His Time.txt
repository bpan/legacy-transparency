In His time, in His time, 
He makes all things beautiful, 
In His time. 
Lord, please show me everyday, 

As Youâ€™re teaching me Your way. 
That You do, just what You say, 
In Your time. 

In Your time, in Your time, 
You make all things beautiful 
In Your Time.  

Lord, my life to You I bring, 
May each song I have to sing. 
Be to You a lovely thing, 
In Your time.
