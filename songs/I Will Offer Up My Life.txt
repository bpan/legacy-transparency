I will offer up my life, 
In spirit and truth. 
Pouring out the oil of love 
As my worship to You. 

In surrender I must give, 
My every part. 
Lord, receive the sacrifice 
Of a broken heart. 

Jesus, what can I give, what can I bring. 
To so faithful and friend, to so loving a King. 
Savior what can be said, what can be sung. 
As a praise of Your name, 

For the things You have done? 
Oh my words could not tell, not even in part. 
Of the debt of love 
That is owed by this thankful heart. 

You deserve my every breath 
For Youâ€™ve paid the great cost. 
Giving up Your life to death, 
Even death on a cross 

You took all my shame away, 
There defeated my sin. 
Opened up the gates of heaven, 
And have beckoned me in.
