Over all the earth You reign on high. 
Every mountain stream, every sunset sky. 
And my one request, Lord my only aim. 
Is that You reign in me again. 

Lord, reign in me, reign in Your power. 
Over all my dreams in my darkest hour. 
You are the Lord of all I am. 
So won’t You reign in me again. 

Over every thought, over every word.  
May my life reflect the beauty Of my Lord.  
‘Cause You mean more to me 
than any earthy thing. 
So won’t You reign in me again.
