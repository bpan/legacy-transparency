I’ll obey and serve You, 
I’ll obey because I love You. 
I’ll obey – my life is in Your hands. 

It’s the way to prove my love 
When feelings go away; 
If it costs me everything, 
I’ll obey.
 
Please let me serve, 
I don’t care how much You ask of me 
I owe it to You anyway. 
I need to be serving You 
So Your work can be done.
