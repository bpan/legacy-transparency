Where would I be without You Jesus?  
How can I live without your love?  
What would I do without You Jesus?  
How could I face another day? 

Your mercy toward me, 
Is more than I could understand. 
Where would I be without Your love? 

Jesus, Jesus, how I love Your name.  
Jesus, Jesus, how I love Your name.  

You’ve been so good to me, Lord Jesus 
You’ve blessed my life in every way.  
I’d be so lost without You Jesus.  
Without You teaching Me the way.
