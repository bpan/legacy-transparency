Faithful One, so unchanging, 
Ageless One, Youâ€™re my Rock of Peace. 
Lord, of all, I depend on You.  
I call out to You, again and again. 
I call out to You, again and again. 

You are my Rock in times of trouble, 
You lift me up, when I fall down. 
All through the storm, 
Your love is, the anchor. 
My hope is in You alone.
