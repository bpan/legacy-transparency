Oh Lord my God, 
When I in awesome wonder. 
Consider all the works Thy hand has made.
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder. 
Thy works throughout the universe displayed. 

Then sings my soul, 
My Savior God to Thee. 
“How great Thou art, how great Thou art.” 

And when I think, 
That God His Son not sparing 
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in. 
That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing. 
He bled and died to take away my sin. 

When Christ shall come 
With shouts of acclamation 
And take me home, 
What joy shall fill my heart 
Then shall I bow, in humble adoration 
And there proclaim, 
“My God, how great Thou art.”
