Father of lights 
You are all that I want to see, 
Shine on me. 
Sweet Lamb of God 
Come and pour Your life over me, 
Over me. 
 
I will hope in You for You are all I need 
I will trust in You alone. 
Light of the world, Lamb that was slain 
Every knee will bow before Your holy name. 
King of all Kings, true Prince of Peace 
I worship You, I fall down to my knees.
 
I hope in You,  light of the world 
I hope in You,  light of the world 
I hope in You,  light of the world 
I hope in You,  light of the world
 
Spirit of God, 
Come and breath Your life into me, 
Into me. 
Light of the world, 
Wonâ€™t You come and shine Your light on me, 
Shine on me.
