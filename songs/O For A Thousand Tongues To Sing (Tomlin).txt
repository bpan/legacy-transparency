O for a thousand tongues to sing 
My great Redeemer’s praise, 
The glories of my God and King, 
The triumphs of His grace. 

My gracious Master and my God, 
Assist me to proclaim, 
To spread thro’ all the earth abroad, 
The Honors of thy Name. 

Jesus!  The Name that charms our fears 
That bids our sorrows case, 
‘Tis music in the sinner’s ear, 
‘Tis life, and health, and peace. 

He breaks the power of canceled sin, 
He sets the prisoner free; 
His blood can make the foulest clean; 
His blood availed for me. 

He speaks and listening to His voice 
New Life the dead receive 
The mournful broken hearts rejoice 
The humble poor believe 

Glory to God and praise and love 
Be ever, ever giv’n 
By saints below and saints above 
The church in earth and Heav’n 

So come on and sing out 
Let our anthem grow loud 
There is one great love Jesus
