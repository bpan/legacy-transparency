Oh Lord most high, we come before You now, 
And with one heart we ask again. 
That we might worship You in holiness, 
And to Your presence enter in. 

Draw back the veil that we might see Your face, 
And gaze with love into Your eyes. 
And in the wonder of beholding You, 
Our song of worship will arise.
 
Be enthroned, oh God, 
On a throne of praise. 
Let our hearts be filled with the presence 
Of Your glory and Your majesty.
 
Be enthroned, oh God 
Reign oh Rightful King. 
As our heart song rises to You 
Through the love that it conveys 
Be enthroned upon our praise, oh God.

Oh Lord in reverence we worship You, 
With heads held high and hearts bowed down. 
We join the hosts of heaven at Your feet, 
And cast before You every crown.
