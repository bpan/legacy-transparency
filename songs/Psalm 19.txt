May the words of my mouth 
And the meditations of my heart. 
Be pleasing to You, pleasing to You.  

May the words of my mouth, 
And the meditations of my heart, 
Be pleasing to You, my God. 

You’re my rock and my redeemer.  
You’re the reason that I sing.  
I desire to be a blessing in your eyes.  

Every hour, and every moment.  
Lord, I want to be Your Servant.  
I desire to be a blessing in Your eyes, 
In Your eyes.
