I have found such joy in my salvation 
Since I gave my heart to You. 
I have found the reason I’m living 
So in love, so near to You. 

I worship You my Lord 
With all my life, praise Your name 
I worship You, worship You, my Lord.

Oh my Lord, my life I’m giving 
A living sacrifice to You. 
Oh my Lord, the reason I’m living 
Is to serve and worship You.
