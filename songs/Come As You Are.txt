Come as you are, 
Come and drink from the living water 
That flowed from His hands, flowed from His side. 
 
Come as you are, 
Come and bathe in the healing water, 
Cleansing from sin, releasing new life.
 
Draw near to Him 
And He’ll draw near to you. 
He’s been waiting for you, 
To call on His name, so come, 
Come as you are.
