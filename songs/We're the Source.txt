You’ve kept watch over me 
Since I was a child. 
You’ve stayed close when my heart has gone running wild. 
You’ve welcomed me back again and again. 
You’ve offered Your kindness, forgiven my sin. 
 
You’re the source of all the good gifts I know. 
No one else can equal the love You show. 
Though my praise for You often comes so slow. 
How I long for my life with You to grow.
 
In Your actions You show 
The proof of Your care. 
In Your presence comes comfort, You’re everywhere. 
In Your mercy I find hope that will last. 
In Your second life I am saved from the past.
