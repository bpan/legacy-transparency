Say to those who are fearful hearted, 
Do not be afraid,
The Lord your God is strong 
And with His mighty arms. 
When you call on His name, 
He will come and save. 

He will come and save You, 
He will come and save You. 
Say to the weary one, 
Your God has surely come,
He will come and save You, 

He will come and save You.
He will come and save You.
Lift up your eyes to Him, 
You will arise again. 
He will come and save You. 

Say to those who are broken hearted, 
Do not lose your faith.
The Lord your God is strong 
And with His loving arms. 
When you call on His name, 
He will come and save. 

He is our refuge in the day of trouble, 
He is our shelter in the time of storm. 
He is the tower in the day of sorrow, 
Our fortress in the time of war.
