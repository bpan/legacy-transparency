Wonderful so wonderful 
Is your unfailing love
Your cross is spoken mercy over me
No eye has seen, no ear has heard, 
No heart can fully know
How glorious, how beautiful you are 

Beautiful one I love
Beautiful one I adore
Beautiful one my soul must sing

Powerful so powerful 
Your glory fills the skies
Your mighty works displayed for all to see
The beauty of your majesty 
Awakes my heart to sing
How marvelous, how wonderful you are 

You’ve opened my eyes 
To your wonders anew
Captured my heart with this love
‘Cause nothing on earth 
Is as beautiful as you
