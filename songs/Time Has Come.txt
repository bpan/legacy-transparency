Found love beyond all reason 
You gave Your life, Your all for me 
And called me Yours forever 

Caught in the mercy fallout 
Found hope, found life, 
Found all I need 
You’re all I need

The time has come 
To stand for all we believe in 
So I, for one, am gonna 
Give my praise to You

Today, today, it’s all or nothing 
All the way, my praise goes out to You 
Yeah, all the praise goes out to You

Today, today, I live for one thing 
To give You praise, 
In everything I do 
Yeah, all the praise goes out to You

All we are is Yours 
All we’re living for 
Is all You are, is all that You are
