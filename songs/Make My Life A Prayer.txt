Make my life a prayer to You, 
I want to do what You want me to. 
No empty words and no white lies, 
No token prayers, no compromise. 

I want to shine the light You gave, 
Through Your Son You sent to save us, 
From ourselves and our despair.  
It comforts me to know You’re really there. 

Well I want to thank You now 
For being patient with me 
Oh, it’s so hard to see, when my eyes are on me. 

I guess I’ll have to trust 
And just believe what You say 
Oh, You’re coming again, 
Coming to take me away. 

I want to die and let You give 
Your life to me so I might live 
And share the hope You gave to me 
The love that sets me free. 

I want to tell the world out there, 
You’re not some fable or fairy tale 
That I’ve made up inside my head.  
You’re God the Son, 
You’ve Risen from the dead. 

I want to die and let You give 
Your life to me so I might live 
And share the hope You gave to me.  
I want to share the love that set me free.
