Bread of Life, Living Water, 
Come feed my soul, 
Come quench my thirst. 
Bread of Life, Living Water, 
Come feed my soul, 
Come quench my thirst. 

Bring the fire of Your Spirit, 
Return the passion of my youth. 
That I may burn for You, 
That I may burn for You. 
Set my heart ablaze, 
That I may burn for You. 

Holy Ghost, gentle Spirit, 
Send Your wind through me, 
Let my heart be stirred. 
Holy Ghost, gentle Spirit, 
Send Your wind through me, 
Let my heart be stirred.
