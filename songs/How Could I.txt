How could I but love You, 
My Savior and my God? 
How could I but serve You, 
When on the cross 
You were the servant of all

How could I but follow You 
When all your ways lead to freedom and life 
How could I but love You, 
My Savior and my God? 

How could I… 
 How could I but love you? 
How could I… 
 How could I but serve you? 
How could I but follow You, my God? 

How could I but love You, 
 my comforter, my strength 
How could I but serve You 
When in this life You’ve been so faithful and true 

How could I but follow You 
When someday you’ll open heaven for me 
How could I but love you, my Savior and my God?
