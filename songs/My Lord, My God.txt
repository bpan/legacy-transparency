My Lord, my God 
My Lord, my Love 
I pledge my life to You. 
I’ll go Your way, come what may, 
I surrender to You. 
 
I vow to always be true 
To hold on to You till the end. 
Jesus, glory to You 
My Savior, my King and my friend.
 
My Lord, my God 
My Lord, my Love 
My heart belongs to You. 
I’ll bring my hopes, here are my dreams, 
Yet I surrender to You.
