Jesus, You’re my firm foundation, 
I know I can stand secure 
Jesus, You’re my firm foundation. 
I put my hope in Your holy word, 
I put my hope in Your holy word. 

 I have a living hope (I have a living hope) 
 I have a future (I have a future) 
 God has a plan for me (God has a plan for me) 
 Of this I’m sure, of this I’m sure. 

Your word is faithful (Your word is faithful), 
 Mighty with power (Mighty with power). 
 God will deliver me (God will deliver me), 
Of this I’m sure, of this I’m sure.
