Seek ye first the kingdom of God, 
And His righteousness. 
And all these things 
Shall be added unto You.  
Allelu, alleluia. 

Man shall not live by bread alone, 
But by every word. 
That proceeds from the mouth of God.  
Allelu, Alleluia. 

Ask and it shall be given unto You.  
Seek and ye shall find. 
Knock and the door 
Shall be opened unto you  
Allelu Alleluia.
