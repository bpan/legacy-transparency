Lord, You’re everything I need, 
There’s nothing more I need. 
You shined the light from heaven’s door. 

More and more, I worship You with tears 
They’re all I have to give 
To thank You for the life You gave.
 
Jesus, You’re everything that I’ve ever wanted, 
The blood You shed at Calvary has made me clean, 
You’ve drawn me back to You. 
And I would give everything to be Yours forever, 
The sacrifice of love You shared has set me free 
To sail away with You.
