All hail the power of Jesus' name 
Let angels prostrate fall 
Bring forth the royal diadem 
And crown Him Lord of all 
Bring forth the royal diadem 
And crown Him Lord of all 

Ye chosen seed of Israel's race 
Ye ransomed from the fall 
Hail Him who saves you by His grace 
And crown Him Lord of all 
Hail Him who saves you by His grace 
And crown Him Lord of all 

O that with yonder sacred throng 
We at His feet may fall 
We'll join the everlasting song 
And crown Him Lord of all 
We'll join the everlasting song 
And crown Him Lord of all 

Raise up the crown, rise on the prasies 
Rest on the brow of the King of ages 
Raise up the crown, rise on the prasies 
Rest on the brow of the King of ages
