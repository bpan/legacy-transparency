Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet 
And a light unto my path 
Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet 
And a light unto my path 

When I feel afraid, think Iâ€™ve lost my way. 
Still Your there right beside me. 
Nothing will I fear, 
As long as You are near. 
Please be near me to the end. 

And I will not forget, 
Your love for me and yet, 
My heart forever is wandering. 
Jesus, be my guide, 
And hold me to Your side. 
And I will love You to the end.
