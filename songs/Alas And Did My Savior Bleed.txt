Alas and did my Savior bleed! 
And did my Sovereign die? 
Would He devote that sacred head 
For a sinner such as I?

Was it for sins that I had done 
He groaned upon the tree 
Amazing pity, grace unknown 
And love beyond degree.

My God, why would You shed Your blood 
So pure and undefiled. 
To make a sinful one like me 
Your chosen, precious child.

Well might the sun in darkness hide 
And shut His glories in.  
When Christ, the mighty Maker died 
For man, the creatureâ€™s sin.

Thus might I hide my blushing face 
While His dear cross appears. 
Dissolve my hear in thankfulness 
And melt my eyes to tears.
