You did not wait for me to draw near to You 
But You clothed Yourself in frail humanity 
You did not wait for me to cry out to You 
But You let me hear Your voice calling me 
 
And I’m forever grateful to You 
I’m forever grateful for the cross 
I’m forever grateful to You 
That you came to seek and save the lost.
