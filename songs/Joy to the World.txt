Joy to the world
The Lord is come
Let Earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare him room
And Heavâ€™n and nature sing (3x)

Joy to the world
The Savior reigns
Let all their songs employ
While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains
Repeat the sounding joy (3x)

No more let sins and sorrows gros 
Nor thorns infest the ground 
He comes to make His blessings flow 
Far as the curse is found. (3x)

He rules the world 
With truth and grace 
And makes the nations prove 
The glories of His righteousness 
And wonders of His love (3x)
