You gave it all for me             
My soul desire, my everything 
All I am is devoted to You 
How could I fail to see 
You are the love that rescued me 
And all I am is devoted to You

And oh, how could I 
Not be moved 
Lord here with You 
So have Your way in me 
Cause Lord there is just one thing 
And that I will seek

This is my cry, my one desire 
Just to be where You are Lord 
Now and forever 
It's more than a song, 
My one desire 
Is to be with You, 
Is to be with You, Jesus

The one thing 
The one thing I ask 
Is to be with You
