I love You, Lord 
I worship You 
I love You, Lord, always. 
So thankful, Lord 
You saved my life 
You saved my life today. 
 
Let me be a shining light for You 
Let me be a joy to You always 
Let me be a shining light for You 
Let me be a joy to You always
 
And Lord I love 
To bring to You 
The honor due Your name. 
Just look at what 
You’ve done for me; 
I’ll never be the same.
 
No superman, 
I’m no hero, 
I’m just a man in Your eyes 
But through Your Son 
I’ve overcome 
The father of all lies.
