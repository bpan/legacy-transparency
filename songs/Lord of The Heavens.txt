Lord of the heavens and the earth. 
My Savior Redeemer risen Lord. 
All honor and glory, power and strength. 
To Him upon the throne. 

Holy holy You are worthy.  
Praises to the Son of God. 
Jesus You alone are worthy.  
Crowned in righteousness and peace. 

Glory glory Hallelujah, 
Praises to the great I Am. 
Hosanna join with angels singing. 
Worthy is the Lamb of God.
