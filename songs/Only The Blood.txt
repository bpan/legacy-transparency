Holiness is Your life in me 
Making me clean through Your blood. 
Holiness is Your fire I me 
Purging my heart like a flood. 

I know You are perfect in holiness. 
Your life in me, setting me free, 
Making me holy. 

Only the blood of Jesus, 
Covers all of my sin. 
Only the life of Jesus, 
Renews me form within. 

Your blood is enough, 
Your mercy complete 
Your work of atonement, 
Paid for my debts, making me holy. 
Only the blood of Jesus.
