As we come today, 
We remind ourselves of what we do 
That these songs are not 
Just songs but songs of love for You 

This is a Holy moment now 
Something of Heaven touches earth 
Voices of angels all resound 
We join their song 

Come, come, come 
Let us worship God 
With our hands held high 
And our hearts bowed down 

We will run, run, run 
Through Your gates oh God 
With a shout of Love! 
With a shout of Love! 

Lord with confidence we come before 
Your throne of Grace 
Not that we deserve to come, 
But you have paid the way 

You are the Holy King of all 
Heaven and Earth are in Your hands 
All of the angels sing Your song 
We join them now
