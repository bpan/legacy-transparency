This is my cry, 
This is my song. 
You are my guiding light 
When the way is unknown. 

And when these sunny skies 
Turn shades of gray 
I’ll stay close by Your side 
As You lead the way.
 
Jesus lead on, I will follow 
Jesus lead on, 
Let Your love light the way. 
Jesus lead on, I will follow 
Jesus lead on.
 
Hear now this cry 
Hear now this song. 
You are the guiding light 
For this journey I’m on.
 
And when my vision is clouded 
By the wind and the rain. 
I’ll stay close by Your side 
As You lead the way.
 
Lead me on, lead me on 
Lead me on, I will follow.
