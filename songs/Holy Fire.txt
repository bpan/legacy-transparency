Holy fire from heaven 
Descend to us we pray, 
Let us burn again
Holy fire from heaven, 
Consume our hearts today 
Let us burn again, let us burn again 

Holy breath from heaven 
Descend to us we pray, 
let us breathe again
Holy breath from heaven, 
Revive our hearts today 
Let us breathe again, let us breathe 

Waiting in expectancy 
Surrendered to Your sovereignty 
Weâ€™re hungry for true intimacy, Lord 
For the things of your heart 

Holy stream from heaven, 
Descend to us we pray, 
let us drink again
Holy stream from heaven, 
bring new life today 
Let us drink again, let us drink again
