It’s all about You, Jesus. 
And all this is for You, 
For Your glory and Your fame. 
It’s not about me; 
As if You should do things my way. 
You alone are God, and I surrender 
to Your ways.
 
Jesus, lover of my soul 
All consuming fire is in Your gaze. 
Jesus, I want You to know 
I will follow You all my days.
 
For no one else in history is like you 
And history itself belongs to You 
Alpha and Omega, 
  You have loved me, 
And I will share eternity with You
