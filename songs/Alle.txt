May the path that I walk, 
Be the path of righteousness. 
May the words of my mouth give You praise. 
May my heart be Your home 
And the place of holiness. 

Lord I worship You in love. 
Oh I lift You, lift You up.
 
Alle, alleluia 
To the Father, to the Lord. 
Alle, alleluia 
To the Savior forevermore.
