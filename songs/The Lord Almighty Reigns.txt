Alleluia, alleluia 
Alleluia, the Lord reigns. 
Alleluia, alleluia 
Alleluia, the Lord almighty reigns. 
 
He has shown His awesome power 
He has triumphed mightily. 
Heâ€™s the victor over darkness and the grave. 
He has broken chains that bound us 
He has set the prisoner free 
By His own great mercy, we are saved.
