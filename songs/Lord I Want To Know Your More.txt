Just the time I feel that I’m 
At peace with the world that’s mine. 
I feel at ease, I feel at home, 
And I know that I’m not alone. 

Then in my rest there comes a test 
That shakes me till again I know. 
That what I’ve had, is not enough, 
And again I’ve got to grow. 

Lord, I want to know You more, 
Deep within my heart 
I want to know You, 
Lord I want to know You and, 
I would give my final breath, 

To know You in 
Your death and resurrection.  
Lord, I want to know You more. 
Lord I want to know You more. 

The full supply I find as I 
Move closer to the heart of God. 
To strengthen me, to nourish me, 
And to fill my mind with Him. 

I’ve truly grown, but even so, 
My hunger hasn’t gone away. 
Still I long, still I thirst
To know Him more each day.
