Show me, dear Lord, how You see me through Your eyes 
So that I can realize Your great love for me. 
Teach me, O Lord, that I am precious in Your sight 
That as a father loves his child, so You love me. 
 
I am Yours because You have chosen me. 
I’m Your child because You’ve called my name. 
And Your steadfast love will never change 
I will always be Your precious child.
 
Show me, dear Lord, that I can never earn Your love 
That a gift cannot be earned, only given. 
Teach me, O Lord, that Your love will never fade 
That I can never drive away Your great mercy.
