I stand to praise You 
But I fall on my knees. 
The spirit is willing 
But my flesh is so weak. 
 
So light the fire in my soul, 
Fan the flame, 
Make me whole. 
Lord, You know just where Iâ€™ve been, 
So light the fire in my heart again.
 
I feel Your arms around me 
As the power of Your healing begins. 
Your Spirit moves right through me 
Like a mighty rushing wind.
