No eye has seen, and no ear has heard 
And no mind has ever conceived 
The glorious things that You have prepared, 
For everyone who has believed. 

You brought us near 
And You called us Your own 
And made us joint heirs with Your son. 

How high and how wide, 
How deep and how long 
How sweet and how strong is Your love. 
How lavish Your grace, 
How faithful Your ways, 
How great is Your love, O Lord.

Objects of mercy who should have known wrath 
Were filled with unspeakable joy. 
The riches of wisdom, unsearchable wealth, 
And the wonder of knowing Your voice. 
You are our treasure and our great reward, 
Our hope and our glorious King.
