O Lord, I am amazed at Your love for me. 
When I was lost and alone in the darkness, You found me. 
You have poured out Your infinite grace 
Lord, what can I say? 
You are deserving of all I can give 
You deserve all of my praise. 
 
So I thank You, Lord. 
I thank You, Lord. 
I thank You, Lord, for Your great love.
 
O Lord, How could I ever repay Your love? 
You have given the greatest treasure of all, Your Son. 
You have shown me Your infinite love 
Lord, what can I say? 
You are deserving of all I can give 
You deserve all of my praise.
