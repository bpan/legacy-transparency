As Your people we have gathered 
With the angels we praise 
The King of Glory, full of splendor 
Who knows us each by name 

We invite You Holy Spirit 
Come establish Your throne 
In this place 

We exalt You oh Lord 
We exalt You oh Lord 
We exalt You oh Lord 

Let Your heavens be filled 
With the sound of our praises 
We exalt You oh Lord 

As Your people we have gathered 
To celebrate Your Name 
We lift our voices in a chorus of honor 
To You the Ancient of Days 
We cannot keep silent 
Or the rocks will cry out in our place
