I just want to love, 
I just want to sing 
To the One above who has touched this thirsty soul. 
(repeat) 
And now I’ll never be the same. 
 
I’ll always love You, 
I’ll always sing to You, Jesus. 
I long to worship You in Spirit and in truth. 
(repeat)
 
Every day I’ll come, 
Spend my life with You, 
Learning of Your heart, what You’re calling me to do. 
(repeat) 
And now I’ll never be the same.
 
And with this song 
We’ll lift the name of Jesus higher. 
And with a shout we’ll raise up one voice.
