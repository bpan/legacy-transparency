Stir in me a fire that the world cannot explain, 
I come to worship You. 
Stir in me a passion that my heart cannot contain, 
I come to worship You. 

Hold me, break me, mold me, 
And make me more and more like You; 
I come to worship You. 
To love You, fear You, draw ever near You 
As I worship You; 
I come to worship You.
