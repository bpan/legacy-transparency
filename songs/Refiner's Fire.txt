Purify my heart, let me be as gold 
And precious silver. 
Purify my heart, let me be as gold 
Pure gold. 
 
Refiner’s fire, my heart’s one desire 
Is to be holy, 
Set apart for You Lord. 
I choose to be holy, 
Set apart for You my master, 
Ready to do Your will.
 
Purify my heart, cleanse me from within 
And make me  holy. 
Purify my heart, cleanse me from my sin, 
Deep within.
