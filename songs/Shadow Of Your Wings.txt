My spirit rests in You alone, 
You’re all I know. 
Embrace and touch me like a child, 
I’m safe in You. 

You’re my shelter through it all. 
You’re my refuge and my strength. 
Lord, I hide in the shadow of Your wings 

My Lord, You’re faithful, 
You supply all good things. 
You know completely all my thoughts, 
My deepest needs.
