Salvation spring up from the ground 
Lord, rend the heavens and come down 
Seek the lost and heal the lame 
Jesus, bring glory to Your name 

Let all the prodigals run home 
All of creation waits and groans 
Lord, weâ€™ve heard of Your great fame 
Father, cause all to shout Your name 

Stir up our hearts, oh God 
Awaken our spirits to awe who You are 
Put a cry in us 

So deep inside that we cannot find 
The words we need 
We just weep and cry out to You
