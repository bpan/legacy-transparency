Lord we ask for Your boldness and power 
Lord we ask for your courage and faith. 
So that we may be freed by your Spirit 
So that we may be free to obey. 

 Come and give us your heart for the lost, Lord 
 With all our breath, Father hear as we say… 

This is our cry, Lord 
For our families, our neighbors, our friends 
Won’t you open our eyes 

Spend our lives, Lord 
As a witness of one who will choose to abide 
And rely on Your might 
Spirit come, come and make this our cry 

We confess that we’re tired and we’re weary 
We confess that our hearts are not right. 
Yet the world all around us is dying 
To see the Truth that we hide in our lives. 

 Come awaken our days with this passion 
 On my knees, come and tear down my pride. 

You are worthy (we cry) 
You are worthy (we cry) 
Help us offer our lives 

You are worthy (we cry) 
You are worthy (we cry) 
Help us give up our rights 

This is my cry, Lord 
For my family, my neighbors, my friends 
Won’t you open my eyes 

Spend my life, Lord 
As a witness of one who will choose to abide 
And rely on Your might 
Spirit come, come and make this my cry 

You are worthy (we cry) 
You are worthy (we cry) 
Help me offer my life 

You are worthy (we cry) 
You are worthy (we cry) 
Help me give up my rights
