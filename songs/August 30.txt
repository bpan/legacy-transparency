Thank You for the chance to live again 
I will run only for You. 
Clouds had gathered all around my head 
But these hands, they lifted me. 
And I’ll tell of this love that saved me. 
 
Thank You for the chance to live again 
I will run always for You 
Walking closer, You are all I have in this world 
Only You. 
And I’ll tell of this love that saved me.

And I’ll wait for this love to break 
I’ll come to You 
Yes, I’ll run to You 
And I’ll wait for this love to break. 
I’ll run to You 
Yes, I’ll come to You 
I’ll be one with You.
