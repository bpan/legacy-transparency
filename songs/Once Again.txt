Jesus Christ, 
I think upon Your sacrifice 
You became nothing, 
Poured out to death 

Many times, 
I’ve wondered at this gift of life 
And I’m in that place once again 
And I’m in that place once again 

And once again I look upon 
The cross where you died 
I’m humbled by Your mercy 
And I’m, broken inside 
Once again I thank You 
Once again I pour out my life 

Now you are 
Exalted in the highest place 
King of the heavens 
Where one day I’ll bow 

But for now, 
I marvel at this saving grace 
And I’m full of praise once again, 
I’m full of praise once again. 

Thank You for the cross, 
Thank You for the cross, 
Thank You for the cross…my friend
