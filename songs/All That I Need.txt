All that I am, all that Iâ€™ll ever be 
I give to You 
Lord, make me more like thee. 
Make me more like thee. 

Oh Lord, I love You, I love Your ways 
For You are strong when I am weak 
I lay my life down at Your feet 
For You are all that I need

Just as I am, I come to You oh Lord 
And this is all I am 
Unless You make me more. 
Make me more like thee.
