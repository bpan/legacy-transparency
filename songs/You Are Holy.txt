The King who  &nbsp;(He is mighty God)

Adore Him  &nbsp;(He’s the Great I Am)

I will bow down  &nbsp;(He’s my Prince of Peace)
Before Him  &nbsp;(Who is the Lamb)
I will sing to  &nbsp;(He’s my Living God)
And worship  &nbsp;(He’s my saving grace)
The King who  &nbsp;(He will reign forever)
Is worthy  &nbsp;(He is Ancient of Days)

I will love and  &nbsp;(He is Alpha, Omega)
Adore Him  &nbsp;(Beginning and End)
I will bow down  &nbsp;(He’s my Savior, Messiah)
Before Him &nbsp;(Redeemer and friend)

He's my Prince of Peace
And I will live my life for Him
