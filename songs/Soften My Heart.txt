Soften my heart with oil, 
Open my eyes to see, 
Fill me with understanding, 
Soften my heart to receive. 
 
I want all that You have for me. 
Jesus, all that You have for me. 
Open my understanding, 
Soften my heart to receive. 
I want all that You have for me.
 
Don’t let my heart be fallow, 
Don’t let my heart be hard. 
Water me with Your Spirit, 
Soften the ground of my heart.
