Where could I go from Your Spirit.  
How could I hide from Your eyes?  
How could I wander away from You.  
Knowing that You are so wise?  

If I take the wings of the morning, 
And dwell in the depths of the sea.  
Even the darkness hides nothing from You 
And with Your hand You will lead me. 

For You did knit me together, 
Even before I was born. 
I will confess You and praise You, 
You are my wonderful Lord.
