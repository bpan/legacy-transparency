Holy, You are still holy 
Even when the darkness surrounds my life 
Sovereign, You are still sovereign 
Even when confusion has blinded my eyes 

Lord I don't deserve your kind affection 
When my unbelief has kept me from Your touch 
I want my life to be a pure reflection
Of Your love 

So I come into Your chambers 
And I dance at Your feet Lord 
You are my savior and I'm at Your mercy 
All that has been in my life up to now 
Belongs to You, for You are still holy
