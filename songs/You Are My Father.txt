Almighty God, Ruler of the earth, 
Robed in majesty for all the world to see. 
 
Lamb that was slain, Name above all names, 
King of kings, all creation sings 
That You, alone, are God. 
 
And I know You are 
All these things and more, O Lord. 
But most of all, I know You are my Father.
 
Faithful and true, thereâ€™s no one like You. 
Holy One of Israel, all men will bow to You 
And say that You are God.
 
And I know You are 
All these things and more, O Lord. 
But most of all, I know that I know You are 
All these things and more, O Lord. 
But most of all, all, 
Most of all, ooh 
You are my Father.
