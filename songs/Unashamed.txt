I have not much to offer You,
Not near what You deserve
But still I come because Your cross
Has placed in me my worth

Oh Christ, my King of sympathy,
Whose wounds secure my peace 
Your grace extends to call me friend
Your mercy sets me free

And I know I’m weak,
I know I’m unworthy to call upon Your Name
But because of grace, because of Your mercy,
I stand here unashamed

I can’t explain this kind of love,
I’m humbled and amazed
That You’d come down from heavens heights,
And greet me face to face

Here I am at Your feet,
In my brokeness complete
