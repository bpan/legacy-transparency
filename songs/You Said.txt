You said, “Ask and you will receive whatever you need.” 
You said, “Pray and I’ll hear from heaven 
And I’ll heal your land.” 

You said, your glory will fill the earth,     
Like water the seas. 
You said “Lift up your eyes, 
The harvest is near, the kingdom is near 
You said 

“Ask and I’ll give the nations to you”. 
Oh Lord, that’s the cry of my heart. 
Distant shores and the islands will see 
Your light, 
As it rises on us.
