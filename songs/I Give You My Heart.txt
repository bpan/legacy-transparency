This is my desire, to honor You. 
Lord, with all my heart, I worship You. 
All I have within me, I give You praise; 
All that I adore is in You. 
 
Lord I give You my heart, I give You my soul; 
I live for You alone. 
Every breath that I take, every moment Iâ€™m awake, 
Lord, have Your way in me.

I give You my heart, 
I give You my soul, 
I live for You alone.
