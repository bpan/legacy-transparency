I come to You oh Lord 
With a thankful heart. 
I sing my song of love 
And praise for who You are. 
 
For You oh Lord are a great God, 
Glorious and strong. 
You oh Lord are a great God, 
I worship You  alone.
 
I bring to You oh Lord 
A sacrifice of praise 
And of Your wondrous works 
Iâ€™ll sing for all my days.
