Though storms of strife assail me without warning 
Though they try to steal my joy away. 
I will find rest in knowing You have saved me 
Precious Jesus, Rock of my Salvation. 
 
Though times I stumble and fall short of Your standard 
I’ll rest assured there is love enough for me. 
For I find strength in knowing You have saved me 
Precious Jesus, Rock of my Salvation.
 
Oh my Jesus, Rock of my Salvation 
Who bore the weight of Calvary’s wood and shame. 
And cleansed my sin in the crimson flow of mercy 
Precious Jesus, Rock of my Salvation.
