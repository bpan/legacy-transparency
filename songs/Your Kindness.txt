Waiting for angry words to sear my soul, 
Knowing I don’t deserve another chance; 
Suddenly the kindest words I’ve ever heard 
Come flooding through my heart. 
 
It’s Your kindness that leads us to repentance, O Lord; 
Knowing that You love us no matter what we do. 
Makes us want to love You. 
It’s Your kindness that leads us to repentance, O Lord; 
Knowing that You love us no matter what we do. 
Makes us want to love You, too.
 
No excuse, no one to blame, no where to hide; 
The eyes of God have found my failures, found my pain. 
He understands my weaknesses and knows my shame, 
But His heart never leaves me.
