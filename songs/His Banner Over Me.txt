He brought me to 
His banqueting table (echo), 
He brought me to 
His banqueting table (echo), 
And His banner, over me is love. 

I am my Beloved’s and He is mine (echo) 
I am my Beloved’s and He is mine (echo) 
And His banner, over me is love. 
Yes His banner over me is love. 

And we can feel the love 
of God in this place 
We believe Your goodness, 
We receive Your grace 

We delight ourselves 
at Your table oh God. 
You do all things well, 
just look at our lives. 

His banner over you, 
 His banner over me. 
His banner over us, is love love love. 
His banner over you, 
 His banner over me. 
His banner over us, is love love love.
