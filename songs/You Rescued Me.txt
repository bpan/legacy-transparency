You rescued me, and picked me up.  
A living hope of grace revealed 
A life transformed In righteousness.  
Oh lord, You have rescued me 

Forgiving me, You healed my heart, 
And set me free from sin and death 
You brought me life, 
You’ve made me whole.  
Oh Lord, You have rescued me 

And you loved me before I knew You 
And You knew me for all time 
I’ve been created in Your image, 
Oh Lord 

And You brought me 
And You sought me.  
Your blood poured out for me 
A new creation in Your image, Oh Lord.  
You rescued me.  You rescued me.
