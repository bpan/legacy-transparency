I can only imagine what it will be like
When I walk by Your side 
I can only imagine, what my eyes will see
When Your face is before me 
I can only imagine, I can only imagine

Surrounded by Your Glory,
What will my heart feel?
Will I dance for you, Jesus 
Or in awe of You, be still?

Will I stand in Your presence, 
Or to my knees will I fall?
Will I sing Hallelujah,
Will I be able to speak at all? 
I can only imagine, I can only imagine 

I can only imagine when that day comes
When I find myself standing in the Son 
I can only imagine when all I will do
Is forever, forever worship You 
I can only imagine, I can only imagine
