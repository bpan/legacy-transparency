Your love has captured me 
Your grace has set me free 
Your life, the air I breathe 
Be glorified in me 

You set my feet to dancing 
You set my heart on fire 
In the presence of a thousand kings, 
You are my one desire 

I stand before You now 
With trembling hands lifted high 
Be glorified! 

Be glorified in me 
Be glorified in me 
Be glorified
