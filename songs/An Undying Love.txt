Grace, grace, 
To all who love the Lord Jesus Christ
With an undying love

Grace, grace, 
To all who love the Lord Jesus Christ
With an undying love

Give me an undying love for You.
Lord wonâ€™t You take me to the cross.
 I count it all as loss.
Please burn away all dross so that nothing else remains.
But an undying love for you.
