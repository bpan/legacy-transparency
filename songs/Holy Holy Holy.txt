Holy, holy, holy.
Lord God Almighty.  
Early in the morning 
Our song shall rise to Thee 
Holy, holy, holy. 
Merciful and mighty. 
God in three persons, blessed Trinity. 

Holy, holy, holy.  
All the saints adore Thee. 
Casting down their gold crowns 
Around the glassy sea. 
Cherubim and seraphim, 
Falling down before Thee 
Which wert, and art and 
evermore shall be. 

Holy, holy, holy, 
though the darkness hide Thee 
Though the eyes of sinful man 
Thy glory may not see 
Only Thou art holy, 
there is none beside Thee. 
Perfect in power, in love and purity. 

Holy, holy, holy.
Lord God Almighty. 
All Thy works shall praise Thy name 
In earth and sky and sea. 
Holy, holy, holy.  
Merciful and mighty. 
God in three persons, 
blessed Trinity.
