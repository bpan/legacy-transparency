His love is higher than the highest of mountains 
His love is deeper than the deepest of seas. 
His love it stretches to the farthest horizon, 
And His love, it reaches to me. 

His love is stronger than the angels and demons 
His love it keeps me in my life’s darkest hour. 
His love secures me on the pathway to heaven 
And His love is my strength and power. 

His love is sweeter than the sweetest of honey 
His love is better than the choicest of wine. 
His love satisfies the deepest of hunger. 
And His love in Jesus it’s mine.
