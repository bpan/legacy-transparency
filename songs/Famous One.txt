You are the Lord, the Famous One, Famous One 
Great is Your name in all the Earth 
The heavens declare You’re glorious, glorious 
Great is Your fame beyond the Earth 

 And for all You’ve done and yet to do 
 With every breath I’m praising You 
 Desire of nations and every heart 
 You alone are God, you alone are God 

 The morning star is shining through 
 And every eye is watching You 
 Revealed by nature and miracles 
 You are beautiful, You are beautiful
