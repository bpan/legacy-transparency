Oh Lord, my heart longs to be 
A habitation fit for Thee, 
A place where peace reigns 
And love can flourish, 
A heart where You will feel at home.  

Oh Lord, I want to be like You 
My tongue to speak the works You do, 
My hands to stretch forth in healing others, 
My feet to carry the good news. 

That You are God, You’re the way, 
You’re the truth and You’re the life, 
King of kings, Lord of lords, 
Prince of Peace, Lord Jesus Christ 

And by Your shed blood, 
The Great Redeemer, 
You saved my soul, You paid the price 
You saved my soul, now have my life.
