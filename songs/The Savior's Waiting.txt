The Savior is waiting to enter Your heart 
Why don’t you let Him come in? 
There’s nothing in this world to keep you apart. 
What is your answer to Him? 

Time after time He has waited before. 
And now He is waiting again.  
To see if you’re willing to open the door 
Oh how He wants to come in. 

If you’ll take one look
Toward the Savior, my friend 
You’ll find His arms open wide.  
Receive Him and all of your darkness will end.  
Within Your heart He’ll abide.
