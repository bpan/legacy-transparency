This is my prayer, this is my cry 
I want to go on loving You 
All through the joy, all through the fire 
I want to go on loving You, 
I want to go on loving You. 

Seasons will change, people depart 
I want to go on loving You 
In times of pain, when life is hard 
And when the journey seems so long 
I want to go on loving You

Your love for me, new as the dawn 
Older than time 
Stronger than death 
Greater than life, this love is mine

In everything, through all of my life 
I want to go on loving You 
This is my prayer, this is my cry 
I want to go on loving You 
I want to go on loving You
