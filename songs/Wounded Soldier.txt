I am a wounded soldier 
But I will not leave the fight 
Because the Great Physician is healing me. 

So Iâ€™m standing in the battle 
In the armor of His light 
Because His mighty power is real in me.

I am loved, I am accepted 
By the Savior of my soul. 
I am loved, I am accepted 
And my wounds will be made whole.
