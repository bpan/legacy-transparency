Turn your ear to heaven and hear the noise inside 
The sound of angels’ awe, 
The sound of angels’ songs 
And all this for a King, we could join and sing 
“All to Christ the King!” 

How constant how divine 
This song of ours will rise 
Oh, how constant how divine 
This love of ours will rise, will rise…

O praise Him! O praise Him! 
He is Holy! He is Holy!

Turn your gaze to heaven and raise a joyous noise 
The sound of salvation come, 
The sound of rescued ones 
And all this for a king, angels join to sing 
“All for Christ the King!”

How infinite and sweet, this love so rescuing 
Oh how infinitely sweet 
This great love that has redeemed 
As one, we sing…

Hallelujah! Hallelujah! 
He is Holy! He is Holy!
