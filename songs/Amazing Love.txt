My Lord, what love is this 
That pays so dearly, 
That I, the guilty one 
May go free! 
 
Amazing love, O what sacrifice, 
The Son of God given for me. 
My debt He pays, and my death He dies, 
That I might live. 
That I might live.
 
And so they watched Him die, 
Despised, rejected; 
But oh, the blood He shed 
Flowed for me!
 
And now, this love of Christ 
Shall flow like rivers; 
Come wash Your guilt away, 
Live again!
