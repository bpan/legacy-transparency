When I bow down, You lift me up. 
When I surrender, You free me. 
When I cry out, it’s You who saves me. 
When I give in, You meet my need. 
 
In my strength, I have nothing. 
But in my weakness, You’re crowned my King. 
Oh, Lord Jesus, I bow down before You. 
You’re me God, You’re my King, 
Oh, Lord Jesus, come fill me.
 
 You close my wounds, and heal the scars. 
You cleanse my sin, and comfort me. 
You hold me close, the years they melt from me. 
And I am left a child in Your arms.
