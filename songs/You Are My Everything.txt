You are my everything. 
You are my all in all. 
You’re the song that I sing, 
The answer when I call. 

You are my everything. 
You are my all in all. 
It’s in You that my life is blessed. 
You are my righteousness. 
You are my all in all.
 
You are my everything.  You are my all in all. 
The strength of my life, You lift me when I fall. 
You are my everything.  You are my all in all. 
You’re my Father that cares for me.  You have created me. 
You are my all in all.
