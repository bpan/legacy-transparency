You died for me 
Jesus You died for me. 
You died for me 
Jesus my Lord, You died for me. 
 
You live in me 
Jesus You live in me. 
You live in me 
Such wonderful love that You would live in me.
 
How can it be that You’ve called me Your own. 
Such mercy and grace I have never known. 
I’ve lived a life of turning from You 
But still You call me home again to You.
 
We rejoice in You 
We know true joy in You. 
Jesus we rejoice in You 
Our hearts are filled with love and affection for You.
 
I love You Lord, I love You Lord 
I love You Lord, this is my song of surrender unto You. 
Live in us today Lord and never go away.
