The Lord is gracious and compassionate 
Slow to anger, and rich in love. 
The Lord is gracious and compassionate 
Slow to anger, and rich in love. 
 
And the Lord is good to all 
He has compassion 
In all that He has made.
The Lord is Gracious and 
 
As far as the east is from the west 
Thatâ€™s how far 
He has removed our transgressions from us.
The Lord is Gracious and 
 
Praise the Lord, O, my soul 
Praise the Lord.
