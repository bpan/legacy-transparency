God above all the world in motion 
God above all my hopes and fears 
And I don't care what the world throws at me now 
I'm gonna be all right 

Hear the sound of the gene â€“ rations 
Making loud their freedom song 
All in all that the world would know Your name 
We're gonna be all right

'Cause I know my God saved the day 
And I know His word never fails 
And I know my God made a way for me 
Salvation is here

Salvation is here 
Salvation is here, and He lives in me 
Salvation is here 
Salvation that died just to set me free 
Salvation is here

Salvation is here 
Salvation is here, and He lives in me 
Salvation is here 
'Cause You are alive, and You live in me

Salvation is here 
Salvation is here and He lives in me 
Salvation is here 
'Cause You are alive and You live in me

I know my God saved the day 
And I know His word never fails 
And I know my God made a way for me 
It's gonna be alright

I know my God saved the day 
And I know His word never fails 
And I know my God made a way for me 
It's gonna be alright

Salvation is here 
Salvation is here and He lives in me 
Salvation is here 
'Cause You are alive and You live in me 
Salvation is here
