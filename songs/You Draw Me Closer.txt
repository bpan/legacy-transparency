Lord, it is Your love 
That can find me wherever I run, 
And draw me closer. 
You draw me closer. 
 
Though I turn away 
Your mercy brings me back to You again, 
As You draw me closer. 
You draw me closer.
 
Never have I found an end 
To the gracious love that You extend. 
All I have to do is ask and You are there 
Drawing me closer.
 
Draw me closer.
