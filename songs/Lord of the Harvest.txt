Lord of the harvest, let Your voice be heard 
In every nation, in the farthest corners of the world. 
Shatter the darkness, let Your truth be known, 
Gather the nations to bow at Your throne. 
Lord of the harvest. 
 
The fields are ripe for harvest 
But the laborers are few. 
Father send Your workers, those with hearts for You. 
Out into the vineyard, weeping as they go 
Help them reap a mighty, harvest of souls.
 
Some of us will water, others plant the seed, 
Some of us will battle in the heavenlies. 
None of us take glory, for those who find the truth. 
Jesus their praises, are waiting for You.
