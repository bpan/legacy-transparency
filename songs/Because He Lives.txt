God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus.
He came to love, heal and forgive;
He lived and died, to buy my pardon.
An empty grave is there to prove, 
My Savior lives. 

Because He lives, I can face tomorrow.
Because He lives, all fear is gone;
Because I know, He holds the future;
And life is worth the living, 
Just because He lives. 

And then one day, I’ll cross the river;
I’ll fight life’s final war with pain;
And then death, gives way to victory.
I’ll see the lights of glory and I’ll know He lives.
