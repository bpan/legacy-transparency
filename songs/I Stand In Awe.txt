You are beautiful beyond description, 
Too marvelous for words. 
Too wonderful for comprehension, 
Like nothing ever seen or heard. 

Who can grasp Your infinite wisdom? 
Who can fathom the depths of Your love? 
You are beautiful beyond description, 
Majesty enthroned above. 

And I stand, I stand in awe of You. 
Lord I stand, I stand in awe of You. 
Holy God to Whom all praise is due. 
I stand in awe of You. 

You are beautiful beyond description 
God crushed You for my sin 
In agony and deep affliction 
Cut off that I might enter in. 

Who can grasp this tender compassion? 
Who can fathom Your mercy so free? 
You are beautiful beyond description 
Lamb of God who died for me.
