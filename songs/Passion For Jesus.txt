More and more, 
I hear your Spirit’s Call inside, 
Beckoning my heart 
With passion for You 

More and more, 
I feel a love is growing inside, 
Beckoning my heart 
With a love for Your Son 
Love for Your Son 

We want a new passion for Jesus 
One like we’ve never known 
We want a  new passion for Jesus 
One that will burn in our hearts
Like never before
