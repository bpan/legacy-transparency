When I survey the wondâ€™rous cross 
On which the Prince of Glory died 
My richest gain I count but loss, 
And pour contempt on all my pride 

See from His head, His hands, His feet 
Sorrow and love flow mingled down. 
Did ever such love and sorrow meet, 
Or thorns compose so rich a crown 

O the wonderful cross, 
O the wonderful cross 
Bids me come and die 
And find that I may truly live 

And find that I may truly live 
O the wonderful cross, 
O the wonderful cross 
All who gather here by grace draw near 
And bless Your name 

Were the whole realm of nature mine 
That were an offering far too small 
Love so amazing, so divine 
Demands my soul, my life, my all
