The crucible for silver and the furnace of gold 
But the Lord tests the heart of this child. 
Standing in all purity. 
 
God, our passion is for holiness 
Lead us to the secret place of praise.
 
Jesus, holy one, 
You are my heartâ€™s desire. 
King of kings, my everything 
You set this heart on fire.
 
Father take this offering
With our song we humbly praise You 
You have brought Your holy fire to our lips. 
Standing in Your beauty Lord 
 
Your gift to us is holiness 
Lead us to the place where we can sing.
