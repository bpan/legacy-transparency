Lord You have my heart, 
And I will search for Yours. 
Jesus take my life and lead me on. 

Lord You have my heart, 
And I will search for Yours. 
Let me be to You, a sacrifice. 

And I will praise You Lord (echo) 
And I will sing of love come down (echo) 
And as You show Your face (echo) 
Weâ€™ll see Your glory here.
