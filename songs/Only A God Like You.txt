For the praises of man, I will never ever stand 
For the kingdoms of this world 
I’ll never give my heart away or shout my praise 
My allegiance and devotion 
My heart’s desire and all emotion 
Go to serve the man who died upon that tree 

Only a God like You, 
Could be worthy of my praise 
And all my hope and faith 
To only a King of all Kings 
Do I bow my knee and sing, 
Give my everything 

To only my Maker, my Father, my Savior 
Redeemer, Restorer, Rebuilder, Rewarder 
To only a God like You, 
Do I give my praise 

Only a God like You 
Only a God like You 
Only a God like You…
