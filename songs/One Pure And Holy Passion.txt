Give me one pure and holy passion, 
Give me one magnificent obsession, 
Jesus, give me one glorious ambition 
For my life, 
To know and follow hard after You. 

To know and follow hard after You, 
To grow as Your disciple in the truth, 
This world is empty, pale, and poor 
Compared to knowing You, my Lord, 
Lead me on, and I will run after You.
