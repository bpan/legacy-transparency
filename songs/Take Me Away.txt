I am looking for 
I am longing for the place 
Where I can lay my head upon Your breasts. 
 
And I am looking for 
The place where You will pour Your oil over me 
All over me.
 
Pour over me 
Pour over me 
Your oil of perfect peace.
 
And I am looking for 
The time when I can steal away 
To find the place of rest, the place of peace. 
And I am looking for 
The time to steal away and be with You 
To be with You.
 
Take me away 
Take me away 
So I can be with You.
