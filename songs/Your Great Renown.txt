Our hearts are longing for 
The glory of the Lord 
To be made known in all the earth 
Lord, let Your kingdom come, 
Lord, let Your will be done 
Yours is the greatest name of all 

We want to see the nations bow 
We want to hear the rising sound 
Of the worship that You deserve 
We want this passion to abound 
A burden for Your great renown 
For Yours is the greatest name of all 

Our hearts are longing 
For the wisdom of the Lord 
To be proclaimed in all the earth 
Your ways are higher than 
The dreams of any man 
Yours is the greatest name of all 

Our hearts are hungry for 
The power of the Lord 
To be displayed in all the Earth 
The message of the cross will 
Bring hope to the lost 
Yours is the greatest name of all
