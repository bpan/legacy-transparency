He is the Lord and He reigns on high, 
He is the Lord. 
Spoke into the darkness created the light, 
He is the Lord. 

Who is like unto Him never ending in day, 
He is the Lord. 
He comes in power when we call on His name, 
He is the Lord.
 
Show Your power, Oh Lord, our God.
Show Your power, Oh Lord, our God.
Oh Lord, our God.
 
Your gospel oh Lord is the hope of our nation, 
You are the Lord. 
Itâ€™s the power of God for our salvation, 
You are the Lord. 
We ask not for riches but look to the cross, 
You are the Lord. 
For our inheritance give us the lost, 
You are the Lord.
 
Send Your power, Oh Lord, our God.
Send Your power, Oh Lord, our God.
Oh Lord, our God.
