Holiness, holiness is what I long for 
Holiness is what I need 
Holiness, holiness is what You want from me. 
 
Take my heart and form it 
Take my mind and transform it 
Take my will and conform it 
To Yours, to Yours, oh Lord.

Faithfulness, faithfulness is what I long for 
Faithfulness is what I need 
Faithfulness, faithfulness is what You want from me.

Righteousness, righteousness is what I long for 
Righteousness is what I need 
Righteousness, righteousness is what You want from me.
