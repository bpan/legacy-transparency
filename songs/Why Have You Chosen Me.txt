Why have you chosen me, 
Out of millions Your child to be. 
You know all the wrongs that I have done 
Oh how could You pardon me, 
Forgive my iniquities, 
To save me give Jesus Your Son. 

Oh Lord, help me be, 
What You want me to be. 
Your Word I will strive to obey.  
My life I now give, for You I will live, 
And walk by Your side all the way. 

I am amazed to know 
That a God so great could love me so, 
Is willing and wanting to bless. 
His love is so wonderful, 
His mercy so bountiful.  
I canâ€™t understand it I confess.
