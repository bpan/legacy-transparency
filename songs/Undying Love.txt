Grace, grace
To all who love the Lord Jesus Christ 
With an undying love. 
 
Give me an undying love for You. 
Lord, won’t You set my heart aflame 
With passion for Your name. 
Give me an undying love for You.
 
Lord, won’t You take me to the cross. 
I count it all as loss. 
Please burn away the dross 
So that nothing else remains 
But an undying love for You.
