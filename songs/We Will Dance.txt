Sing a song of celebration, lift up a shout of praise 
For the Bridegroom will come, the glorious One 
And oh, we will look on his face 
We’ll go to a much better place 
 
Dance with all your might 
Lift up your hands and clap for joy 
The time’s drawing near, when he will appear 
And oh, we will stand by his side 
A strong, pure, spotless bride.
 
We will dance on the streets that are golden 
The glorious bride and the great Son of man. 
From every tongue and tribe and nation 
Will join in the song of the Lamb.
 
Sing aloud for the time of rejoicing is near 
The risen King, our groom, is soon to appear 
The wedding feast to come is now near at hand 
Lift up your voice, proclaim the coming Lamb 
Lift up your voice, proclaim the coming Lamb
