Here I bring my stains and crowns, 
Gentle river wash me now. 
Your love is deeper than I know, 
Your waves higher than I can go 
Lead me in Your holiness, I will follow, I confess 
Glory is the song I sing 
Your life is living me 

Where would I be without You, without You? 
Where would I be without You? 

I will bow before the cross, 
Cherish my redeemer’s cost, 
There is nothing I can do, 
Than only stand amazed by you. 
Your mercy new with everyday, 
Wrapped up in Your arms of grace 
Nothing more, You’re all I need, 
Your life is living me 

Like a waterfall, 
You fill my heart and overflow. 
Like a candle flame, 
You light my way and lead me as I go 
Lead me as I go 

Spirit overflow, let me overflow 
Spirit overflow, let me overflow 
Let me overflow, let me overflow
