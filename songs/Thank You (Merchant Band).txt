Though You were rich, You became poor
Though You were strong, You became weak
Though You were pure, You took on my shame
Though You were God, a man You became

Thank You for saving a sinner as me
Thank You for hearing when I could not speak
Thank You for loving and setting me free
Thank You for saving a sinner as me

Though I was poor, You made me rich
Though I was weak, You made me strong
Though I was lost, You shined a light
Though I was dead, You gave me life

You are higher than the heavens,
Brighter than the sun
Yet You love me, still You love me
You are Chief among ten thousand,
Comparable to none
Yet You love me, still You love me

You are Heir of all creation,
Eternal Blessed One
Yet You love me, still You love me
You are King of glory coming,
The holy Son of God
Yet You love me, still You love me
