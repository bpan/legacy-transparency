You are the sovereign I Am 
Your name is holy 
You are the pure spotless lamb 
Your name is holy 

You are the Almighty One 
Your name is holy 
You are the Christ, God’s own Son 
Your name is holy 

In Your name, there is mercy for sinners 
There is safety within, in Your holy name 
In Your name, there is strength to remain 
To stand in spite of pain, in Your holy name
