Don’t let my love grow cold 
I’m calling out, “Light the fire again.” 
Don’t let my vision die 
I’m calling out, “Light the fire again.” 
 
You know my heart, my deeds 
I’m calling out, “Light the fire again.” 
I need Your discipline 
I’m calling out, “Light the fire again.”
 
I am here to buy gold, refined by the fire. 
Naked and poor, 
Wretched and blind I come 
Clothe me in white 
So I won’t be ashamed 
Lord, light the fire again.
