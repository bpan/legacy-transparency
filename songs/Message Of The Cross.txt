This is the message of the cross, 
That we can be free 
To live in the victory, 
And turn from our sin 

My precious Lord, Jesus, 
With sinners You died 
For there You revealed Your love 
And You laid down Your life 

This is the message of the cross, 
That we can be free 
To lay all our burdens here, 
At the foot of the tree 

The cross was the shame of the world, 
But the glory of God 
For Jesus, You conquered sin 
And You laid down Your life 

You set me free when 
I came to the cross 
Poured out Your blood 
For I was broken and lost 

There I was healed 
And You covered my sin 
It’s there You saved me, 
This is the message of the cross 

This is the message of the cross, 
That we can be free 
To hunger for heaven, 
To hunger for Thee 

“The cross is such foolishness 
To the perishing 
But to us who are being saved 
It is the power of God” 

Let us rejoice at the foot of the cross 
We can be free, glory to God 
Thank You Lord, thank You Lord 
You’ve set us free, glory to God…
