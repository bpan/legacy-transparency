Great is Your faithfulness O God 
You wrestle with the sinner’s heart 
You lead us by still waters and to mercy 
And nothing can keep us apart 

So remember Your people 
Remember Your children 
Remember Your promise 
O God 

Your grace is enough 
Your grace is enough 
Your grace is enough 
For me 

Great is Your love and justice God 
You use the weak to lead the strong 
You lead us in the song of Your salvation 
And all Your people sing along 

Your grace is enough 
Heaven reaching down to us 
Your grace is enough 
For me

God, I see your grace is enough 
I’m covered in Your love 
Your grace is enough 
For me
