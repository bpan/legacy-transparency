Well I thank You Lord, 
That You are my Savior. 
You’re my strength and You’re 
The Rock on which I stand. 

And You give me life, 
And a grace that’s greater 
When I humble myself 
Beneath Your mighty hand 

You bring times of refreshing, 
You bring times of refreshing 
You bring times of refreshing to my soul. 

When I’m weary from the fight, 
Trying to do what’s right. 
You bring times of refreshing to my soul. 

And the day will come 
When we’ll all be gathered  
And the sun will rise 
With healing in it’s wings 

And all the years of pain 
won’t seem to matter.  
When our eyes behold 
Our Teacher and our King.
