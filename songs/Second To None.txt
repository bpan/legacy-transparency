I will have no other gods before me, 
Here on bended knees. 
I will worship and adore Thee, 
Who else can I turn to? 

You’re the only one, 
You’re the only one.

You’re second to none
You’re the King of Israel. 
You’re the Holy One, 
Every knee shall bow. 

And every tongue confess
You’re the highest. 
You’re the bright morning Son, 
You are second to none. 
Second to none. 

Others seek out temporary pleasures, 
But here inside Your love, 
I have found a lasting treasure.  
Who else can I turn to?  

You’re the Only one, 
You’re the only one.
