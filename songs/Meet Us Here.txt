Lord, we have come to this house, 
Where we love to sing Your praises. 
We lift our hearts and our hands, 
To the King of all the Ages. 

Hear us Lord we pray, 
Come Jesus come, 
Come fill this place. 

Meet us here (echo)  
Meet us here Lord. 
We are few but we are strong, 
When You surround us. 

Meet us here (echo)  
Meet us here Lord. 
As we gather in Your name, 
Meet us here.
