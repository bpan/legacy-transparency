We will worship the Lamb of Glory 
We will worship the King of Kings. 
We will worship the Lamb of Glory 
We will worship the King. 

And with our hands lifted high, 
We will worship and sing. 
And with our hands lifted high, 
We come before you rejoicing.

Our hands lifted high to the sky 
And the world wonders why 
We’ll just tell them we’re loving our King. 
We’ll just tell them we’re loving our King.
