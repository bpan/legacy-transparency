Everyday I look to you 
To be the strength of my life. 
You're the hope I hold onto 
To be the strength of my life. 
 
Be the strength of my life 
The strength of my life 
Be the strength of my life, today.
 
Everyday I look to you 
To be the strength of my life. 
Breathe on me and make me new, 
Be the strength of my life.
