Like the sun that rises everyday 
You are so faithful, Lord You are faithful 
Like the rain that You send 
And every breath that I breathe, 
You are so faithful, oh Lord. 

Like a rose that comes alive every spring 
You are so faithful, Lord You are faithful 
Like the life that You give 
To every beat of my heart, 
You are so faithful, oh Lord. 

I see the cross and the price You had to pay,
I see the blood that washed my sins away.

In the midst of the storm
Through the wind and the waves,
You’ll still be faithful,
You’ll still be faithful.

And when the stars refuse to shine 
And time is no more 
You’ll still be faithful,
You’ll still be faithful,
Oh Lord.
