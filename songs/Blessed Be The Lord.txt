Praise the Lord, give thanks to the Lord 
For He is good. (echo)
His steadfast love endures forever
And He is good. (echo) 

We will tell the mighty deeds of the Lord,
And show forth all of His praise, 
Hallelujah! 

Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,
From everlasting to everlasting.
Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, 
From everlasting to everlasting 

Let all God’s people sing Amen, Amen
And all God’s people sing Amen, Amen
And all God’s people sing Amen, 
O praise the Lord!
