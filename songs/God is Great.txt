All creation cries to You 
Worshipping in Spirit and in truth 
Glory to the faithful One, 
Jesus Christ, God’s Son 

All creation gives you praise 
You alone are truly great 
You alone are God who reigns 
For eternity 

God is great, and His praise fills the earth, 
Fills the heavens 
And His name will be praised 
Through all the world 

God is great, sing His praise,
All the earth, all the heavens 
‘Cause we’re living for the glory of Your name, 
The glory of Your name 

All to You, O God, we bring 
Jesus, teach us how to live 
Let Your fire burn in us, that all may hear 
And all may see 

Holy is the Lord 
The whole earth sings 
The whole earth sings
