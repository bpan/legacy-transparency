Let the beloved of the Lord rest secure 
In Him, in Him. 
For He shields them all day 
All day long 
With His love, His love. 
 
And the one the Lord loves 
Rests between His shoulders 
I can rest, find rest.
 
My heart is glad 
With my mouth I will sing 
Of Your love, Your love. 
For You will fill me with joy 
Joy in Your presence 
I am filled with Your joy.
 
Because Iâ€™m one the Lord loves 
And I rest between His shoulders 
I can rest, find rest.
