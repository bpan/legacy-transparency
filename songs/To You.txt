Here I stand, forever in Your mighty hand 
Living with Your promise written on my heart 
I am Yours, surrendered wholly to You 
You set me in Your family, 
Calling me Your own 

Now I, I belong to You, 
Lord I need Your Spirit, 
Your Word, Your Truth 

Hear my cry, 
My deep desire to know You more 
In Your name I will lift my hands to the King, 
This anthem of praise I bring 

Heaven knows I long to love You with all I am. 
I belong to You.
