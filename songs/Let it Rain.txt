I am dry and thirsty, Lord 
Send Your rain, send Your rain. 
Lord I need Your touch again 
Send Your rain, send Your rain. 
 
Let it rain, let it pour from heaven 
Let it rain, to revive my soul. 
I need Your rain, I need Your streams of refreshing 
Until I thirst no more.
 
Lord I need Your cleansing now 
Send Your rain, send Your rain. 
Please forgive my every sin 
Send Your rain, send Your rain.
 
To this dry and weary land 
Send Your rain, send Your rain. 
Lord we need Your touch again 
Send Your rain, send Your rain.
 
Let it rain, all across this nation 
Let it rain, let revival roll. 
We need Your rain 
We need Your streams of refreshing 
For every thirsty soul.
