When peace, like a river, 
Attendeth my way, 
When sorrows like sea billows roll; 
Whatever my lot, 
Thou hast taught me to say, It is well, 
It is well, with my soul. 

It is well (It is well), 
With my soul (With my soul).  
It is well, it is well with my soul. 

Though Satan should buffet, 
Thoâ€™ trials should come.  
Let this blest Assurance control.  
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate 
And Hath shed His own blood for my soul. 

My sin, oh the bliss 
Of this glorious thought, 
My sin not in part, but The whole.  
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more.  
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, 
O my soul! 

And Lord, haste the day when 
My faith shall be sight  
The clouds be Rolled back as a scroll. 
The trump shall resound 
And the Lord shall descend 
Even so, it is well with my soul.
