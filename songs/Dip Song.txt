Guys:  Dip     Girls:  O-O-O 
Who put the grace in the 
gra-gra-gra-gra-grace? 
Who put the faith in the 
fai-fai-fai-fai-faith? 

Who put the love in the … 
la-la-la-la-love? 
Who put the hope in the … 
ho-ho-ho-ho-hope? 

Who was that man, 
I’d like to shake His hand; 
He gave His life 
And He died for you and me 
(wo-oh-oh-oh)
