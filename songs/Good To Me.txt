I cry out, for your hand of mercy to heal me. 
I am weak, and I need Your love to free me. 
Oh Lord, my Rock, my strength in weakness 
Come rescue me oh Lord. 

You are my hope, 
Your promise never fails me. 
And my desire, is to follow You forever. 

For You are good, for You are good, 
For You are good to me. 
For You are good, for You are good, 
For You are good to me.
