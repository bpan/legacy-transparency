Let everything that… 
Everything that… 
Everything that has breath 
Praise the Lord. 

Praise You in the morning.  
Praise You in the evening. 
Praise You when I’m young 
And when I’m old. 

Praise You when I’m laughing.  
Praise You when I’m grieving. 
Praise You every season of my soul. 

If they could see how much You’re worth. 
Your power Your might Your endless love. 
Then surely they would 
never cease to praise… 

Praise You in the heavens, 
Joining with the Angels 
Praising You forever and a day. 

Praise You on the earth now 
Joining with creation.  
Calling all the nations to Your praise. 

I will worship…I will worship… 
I will worship You in everything.
