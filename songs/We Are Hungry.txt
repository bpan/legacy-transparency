Lord, I want more of You 
Living Water, rain down on me 
Lord, I need more of You 
Living Breath of Life come and fill me up 

We are hungry, we are hungry 
We are hungry for more of You 
We are thirsty, oh Jesus 
We are thirsty for more of You 

We lift our holy hands up 
We want to touch you 
We lift our voices higher 
And higher and higher to You
