Who will ascend Godâ€™s holy mountain? 
Who will abide in His presence? 
He who is clean and is pure in heart, 
Who does not lift up his soul to any idol 
Or speak what is false 
 
He will receive blessing from the Lord 
And vindication from God 
He will be of a generation who seeks the Lord, 
Who seeks His face, the God of Jacob 
Who seeks His face, the God of all
 
Lift up your heads, O you gates 
Lift up your heads, you ancient doors 
Lift up your heads that the King of Glory may come in 
That the King of Glory may come in 
That the King of Glory may come in 
That the King of Glory may come in 
That the King of Glory may come in
