Ay-Oh, I will praise Jehovah. 
Ay-Oh, I will praise my Lord. 
Ay-Oh, I will praise Jehovah. 
Ay-Oh, I will praise my Lord. 
 
I will praise Him in the sanctuary, 
I will praise Him for His mighty deeds 
With cymbals, trumpets, tambourines and dancing. 
Let everything with breath come praise the Lord.
 
Itâ€™s a kingdom celebration 
Let the high praises ring, 
We will sing with all creation 
The praises of our King!
 
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia 
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, ay-oh
