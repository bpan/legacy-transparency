You make my joy complete 
(As I abide in You)
You fill my every need 
(As I abide in You) 

I will remain in You for all of my days.
You will shelter me as I give you praise.
I will sing of Your love,
I will bring all of my love. 

You answer every prayer 
(As I abide in You)
I feel Your love and care 
(As I abide in You)
