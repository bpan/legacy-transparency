Open up the skies of mercy 
And rain down the cleansing flood 
Healing waters rise around us 
Hear our cries Lord, let them rise 

It's Your kindness Lord, 
That leads us to repentance 
Your favor Lord is our desire. 
It's Your beauty Lord, 
That makes us stand in silence 
And Your love is better than life. 

We can see Your mercy falling 
You are turning our hearts back again 
Hear our praises rise to heaven 
Draw us near Lord, meet us here.
