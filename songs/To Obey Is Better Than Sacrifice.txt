To obey is better than sacrifice, 
I don’t need Your money, I want your life, 
And I hear you say that I’m coming back soon. 
But you act like I’ll never return. 

Oh you speak of love and My grace so sweet 
How you thrive on milk but reject My meat. 
And I can’t help weeping at how it will be, 
If you keep on ignoring My Word. 

To obey is better than sacrifice, 
I want more 
Than Sundays and Wednesday nights 
Cause if you can’t come to Me everyday. 
Then don’t bother coming at all. 

To obey is better than sacrifice, 
I want hearts of fire, not prayers of ice, 
And I’m coming quickly to give back to You.  
According to what you have done.
