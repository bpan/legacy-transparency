Shout for joy and sing your praises to the King. 
Lift your voice high, let your hallelujah’s ring. 
Come before His throne to worship and adore. 
Enter joyfully now in the presence of the Lord. 
 
You’re my Creator, 
You’re my Deliverer, 
You’re my Redeemer, You are Lord, 
And You’re my Healer. 
You’re my Provider, 
You are my Shepherd and my Guide, 
Jesus, Lord and King, I worship You.
