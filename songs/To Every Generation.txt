 You have been a shelter, Lord 
To every generation, to every generation 
A sanctuary from  the storm 
To every generation, to every generation 
 
Though the mountains fall 
Though the earth should shake 
Though the sea should roar with all the heartache. 
Though the hearts should pound 
Though our throats be dry 
We will lift Your name on high.
