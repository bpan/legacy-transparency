You are my supply, my bread of life 
Still more awesome than I know 
You are my reward, worth living for 
Still more awesome than I know 

You’re my sacrifice of greatest price 
Still more awesome than I know 
You’re my coming King, you are everything 
Still more awesome than I know 

All of you is more than enough for 
All of me for every thirst and 
Every need you satisfy me 
With your love and all I have in you 
Is more than enough 

More than all I want, more than all I need 
You are more than enough for me 
More than all I know, 
More than all I can say 
You are more than enough…
