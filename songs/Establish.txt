We are a people called by grace,
Draw us out of darkness 
We are a people made by love, 
Recreate us…

Come establish your throne everlasting 
Come establish your name over all names
Come and dwell in us 
May your kingdom come We pray Lord Jesus

We want to see your face oh God,
Want to know your mercy 
We want to see your love oh Lord,
For the nations

Bow before the Lord our God,
He is here with us. 
He is near to us.

Come and bless his holy name. 
The name above all names 
The name by which we’re saved

You are the God who longs for us 
You are the God 
Who walks with us, we will follow.
