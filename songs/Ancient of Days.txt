Blessing and honor, glory and power 
Be unto the Ancient of Days
From every nation, all of creation, 
Bow before the Ancient of Days

Every tongue in heaven and earth
Shall declare Your glory 
Every knee shall bow at Your throne in worship
You will be exalted, O God,
And Your kingdom shall not pass away
O Ancient of days

Your kingdom shall reign over all the earth
Sing unto the Ancient of Days
For none can compare to Your matchless worth
Sing unto the Ancient of Days
