Share a little bit of your love my friend.  
Share a little bit of your love  
Share a little bit of your love my friend, 
And it will come back to where it began. 

And watch it grow, watch it grow.  
Watch it grow to where 
It touches every land. 

Help it grow, help it grow. 
Help it grow by only reaching, 
Reaching out to someone 
With your hand.
