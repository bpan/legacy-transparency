A vision of the world aflame; 
Across this globe is written Jesus’ name, 
And the heart of God is burning in the hearts of His people. 
They’re yearning to seek His holy face 
And even in their sleep they’ll speak His name, 
And the Spirit of the Lord on us to set afire. 
 
Oh, we are Your fuel, Lord. 
Oh, set our hearts in a blaze. 
Oh, whatever You say will go, Lord. 
We’ll take up our cross and suffer loss 
For the sake of Your name.
 
A peculiar people with no face. 
They march in step, each one in place; 
Consumed with love for Jesus Christ, the Son. 
In unity they cry aloud. 
The earth then shakes with this righteous sound: 
 “Oh God in heaven, let Your kingdom come!”
