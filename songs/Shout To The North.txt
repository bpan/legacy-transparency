Men of faith rise up and sing 
Of the great and glorious king 
He is strong when you are weak 
In your brokenness complete 

Rise up women of the truth 
Stand and sing to broken hearts 
Who can know the healing power 
Of our awesome King of love 

 Shout to the north and the south 
 Sing to the east and the west 
 Jesus is Savior to all 
 Lord of heaven and earth 

Rise up church with broken wings 
Fill the place with songs again 
Of our God who reigns on high 
By His grace again we’ll fly 

We’ve been through fire, 
We’ve been through rain 
We’ve been refined by the power of Your name 
We’ve fallen deeper in love with you 
You’ve burned the truth on our lips
