As we walk side by side, 
And as His love becomes our guide, 
We will join hands and be one family, 
Because God’s love is 
What the world should see 

As we build each other up, 
He fill our hearts with His love, 
We will join hands, so all the world can see 
We are the Lord’s own family. 

We are the Lord’s own family 
Our Love is what the world will see 
And as we use His love 
To build each other up 
We’re building the Lord’s own family 
Building the lord’s own family.
