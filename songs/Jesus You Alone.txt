Jesus You alone shall be 
My first love, my first love 
The secret place in the highest praise 
Shall be Yours, shall be Yours 

To Your throne I’ll bring devotion. 
May it be the sweetest sound 
Lord, this heart is reaching for You now 

So I’ll set my sights upon You 
Set my life upon Your praise 
Never looking to another way 
You alone will be my passion 
Jesus, You will be my song 
You will find me longing after You 

Day and night I’ll lift my eyes
To seek You, to seek You 
Hungry for a glimpse of You
In glory, in glory
