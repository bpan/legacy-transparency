Jesus, I love You, 
For when I was blind and lost. 
You shed for all Your enemies 
Your blood upon the cross. 

Because You have loved me, 
Now I can love You too. 
Your love flows deep into my heart, 
Then I send it back to You. 

And Jesus, our love, 
Will only grow much deeper. 
Sustained from above 
By Your overflowing grace. 

And Jesus, our love, 
Will only grow much sweeter. 
And someday we shall be together 
Face to face.
