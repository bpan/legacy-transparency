Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o’er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains

Glo…ria, in excelsis Deo
Glo…ria, in excelsis Deo 

Shepherds why this jubilee
Why your joyous strains prolong
See what the glad tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song

Come to Bethelem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing
Come, adore on bended knee
Christ, the Lord, the newborn King
