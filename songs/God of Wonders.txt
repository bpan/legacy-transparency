Lord of all creation 
Of water, earth and sky 
Heavens are Your tabernacle 
Glory to the Lord on high. 

God of wonders beyond our galaxy 
You are holy, holy. 
The universe declares Your majesty 
You are holy, holy. 
Lord of heaven and earth.  (echo)
 
Early in the morning 
I will celebrate the light. 
When I stumble in the darkness 
I will call You name by night.

Hallelujah to the Lord of heaven 
and earth.
