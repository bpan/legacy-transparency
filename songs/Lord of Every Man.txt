Oh, Lord arise, release Your power 
Scatter Your foes this very hour. 
May we hold on to Your holy commands 
You are the Lord of every man. 
 
You hold our lives, You give us breath 
You freed us from the power of death. 
Youâ€™re our salvation our only hope 
You are the Lord of every man.
 
Your voice, it is like thunder over the waters 
Your voice echoes throughout the earth 
We will bow to the sound 
We will bow to the sound of Your voice.
