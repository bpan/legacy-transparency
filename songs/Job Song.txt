Been broken, put through a fire, 
Felt the heat melt all my strength away. 
Felt so lonely, felt so abandoned 
“Where is God?” 
I heard my little voice say 

I need You, I need You 
Oh Lord, please hold me next to You. 
I need You, I need You 
Oh Lord, don’t let me fall from You. 

Lord I know that this world isn’t easy, 
And I know that You never promised no pain 
Trials will come, trials will test me, 
But help me Lord, it’s hard to see them as gain
