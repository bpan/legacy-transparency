I lay my life down at your feet 
Cuz you’re the only one I need 
I turn to you and you are always there 
In troubled times it’s you I seek 
I put you first, that’s all I need 
I humble all I am, all to you 

One Way 
Jesus 
You’re the only One that I could live for 
One way 
Jesus 
You’re the only One that I could live for 

You are always always there 
Every how and everywhere 
Your grace abounds so deeply within me 
You will never ever change 
Yesterday today the same 
Forever til forever means no end 

You are the Way, the Truth, and the Life 
We live by faith and not by sight 
For You 
We’re living all for You
