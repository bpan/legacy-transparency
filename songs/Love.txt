Love the Lord your God 
With all your heart and all your soul 
And all Your mind and love all mankind 
As you would love yourself 

Love the Lord your God 
With all your heart and all your soul 
And all Your mind and love all mankind 
As you would love yourself 

We’ve got Christian lives to live, 
We’ve got Jesus Christ to give. 
We’ve got nothing to hide     
Because in Him we abide.        
Love
