O Lord, how I love to sing Your praises 
O Lord, how I love to dance for You 
O Lord, You have captured my affection 

Forever, I will sing of Your love 
Forever, I will bring to You my life 
Forever, forever, I will worship You.
 
And when I think of what You’ve done 
It makes me shout for joy. 
And when I think of what’s to come 
Living forever in Your presence.
 
Face to face with my 
Magnificent Obsession 
Forever, forever, I will be with You.
