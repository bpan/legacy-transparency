Hallelujah, salvation, and glory 
Honor and power 
To the Lord our God 

For the Lord our God is mighty 
For the Lord our God is omnipotent 
And the Lord our God 
He is wonderful 

All praises be to the King of kings 
And the Lord and lords 
He is wonderful 
All praises be to the King of kings 
And the Lord of lords 
He is wonderful
