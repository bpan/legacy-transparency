King of righteousness 
Who is like You? 
Lord of heaven and earth 
There is none who can compare. 

Pearl of greatest price 
Who is like You? 
Precious sacrifice 
There is none who can compare.

Your unfailing grace still amazes me. 
Set this sinner free and make my heart to sing.

I would do anything 
I would do anything 
To spend eternity with You. 
If I could have just one thing 
If I could have just one thing 
I would choose You 
I would choose You.
