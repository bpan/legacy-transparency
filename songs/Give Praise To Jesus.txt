Give praise to Jesus for He is the King 
Let your voices ascend to His throne 
On the wings of the music 
Let your hearts be raised 
And in one accord make His praise known 

Singing Hallelu 
Hallelu 
Hallelu, Hallelujah 

Lift up His batter and greet Him with praise 
Our Deliverer has set us free 
Bow before Him, adore Him, and worship His name 
There is no other God like Him.
