A God of love is what You are to me 
A greater friend no one could ever be 
In holiness born of Your Spirit’s touch. 
Your never ending love You give so much. 
 
Who would not love You? 
Who would not cherish You? 
Who would not serve You all their days? 
Who would not praise You? 
Who would not honor You? 
Who would not die for You? 
Who would not love You?
 
A Father’s love is what You give to me. 
A guiding hand, a light so I can see. 
In knowing You I have found my heart’s desire. 
In loving You I’ve touched Your holy fire.
