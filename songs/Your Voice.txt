Not in the mighty wind 
Nor in the earthquake 
Not in the blazing fire 
But in the whisper 
Is Your voice. 
 
I want to hear You 
Teach me to listen 
Here in the quietness 
Of this Holy place.
 
Jesus, come talk to me 
So I may know Your will for me. 
Please just come talk to me 
With all my heart, I will obey 
Your voice.
