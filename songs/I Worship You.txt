I give You all the honor 
And praise thatâ€™s due Your name. 
For You are the King of glory, 
The Creator of all things. 
 
Lord I worship You, I give my life to You 
I fall down on my knees.    (2x) 
I worship You.
 
As Your Spirit moves upon me now, 
You meet my deepest need. 
And I lift my hands up to Your throne, 
Your mercy I received.
