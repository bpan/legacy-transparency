Jesus, my Lord, like a refuge unto my soul 
Never turning, evermore I’m learning, 
There’s no one like unto You. 
Jesus, my Lord.

Like a mountain having no end. 
You touch me, love me, 
Flowing all around me, 
Ever and ever again. 

But, oh the crooked trails, 
I’ve walked alone.  
Jesus my Lord. 
You find me.

Make me to turn around and love You. 
Just when I need You ever the more. 
Just when I need You ever the more, 
Jesus my Lord.
