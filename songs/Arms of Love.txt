I sing a simple song of love, 
To my Savior, to my Jesus,
I’m grateful for the things You’ve done,
My loving Savior, oh precious Jesus. 

My heart is glad that You called me Your own,
And there’s no place I’d rather be,

Than in Your arms of love  
In Your arms of love
Holding me still, holding me near 
In Your arms of love.
