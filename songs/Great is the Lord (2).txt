 How great is the love of God 
How strong is the hand of love 
So fine, His mercies are new every morning 
So fine, His mercies are new every day 

We sing a new song 
We sing a new song

Great is the love that paid for all our sins 
Great is the love that gave us life again 
Great is the love of our God
