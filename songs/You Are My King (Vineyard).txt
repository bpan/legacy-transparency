You are my King (You are my King), 
And I love You. 
You are my King (You are my King), 
And I worship You. 

Knelling before You now, all of my life, 
I gladly give to You. 
Placing my hopes and dreams, 
In Your hands, 
I give my heart to You. 

I love You, love You, 
Jesus yes, I love You, love You 
Jesus my King.
