Oh Lord, here we are again, 
The people that bear Your name 
Lifting our hands in praises to You 
In adoration 
Beholding Your glory. 
Oh Lord, we worship You. 
 
Mercy, mercy 
May the God of mercy shine on us 
Shine on us.
 
Won’t You shine on us 
Won’t You shine on us 
Won’t You shine on us 
Won’t You shine on us.
