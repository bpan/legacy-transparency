Single minded, whole hearted 
One thing I ask 
Single minded, whole hearted 
One thing I ask 

That I may gaze upon Your beauty, O Lord 
That I may seek Your holy face 
That I may know You in an intimate way 
And follow after You all of my days 

All of life comes down 
To just one thing 
And thatâ€™s to know You oh Jesus 
And make You known
