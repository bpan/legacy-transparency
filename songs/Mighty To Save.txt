 Everyone needs compassion,
Love that’s never failing
 Let mercy fall on me
 Everyone needs forgiveness, 
The kindness of a Saviour
 The hope of nations

   Saviour, He can move the mountains
   My God is mighty to save
   He is mighty to save
   Forever, Author of Salvation
   He rose and conquered the grave
   Jesus Conquered the grave


 So take me as you find me,
All my fears and failures
 Fill my life again
 I give my life to follow
Everything I believe in
 Now I surrender

  Shine your light and let the whole world see
  We’re singing for the glory of the risen King
  Jesus, shine your light
And let the whole world see
  We’re singing for the glory of the risen King
