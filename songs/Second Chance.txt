You called my name, reached out Your hand
Restored my life, and I was redeemed
The moment You entered my life

Amazing grace Christ gave that day, 
My life was changed when from my shoulders
Fell the weight of my sin

So it’s with everything I am, I reach out for Your hand
The hope for change, the second chance Iíve gained
On You I throw my life, casting all my fears aside
How could greater love than this ever possibly exist

Consume my thoughts as I rest in You
I’m now in love with a Savior
Bearing the marks of His love

So I wait upon You now with my hands released to You 
Where a little faith’s enough to see mountains lift and move
And I wait upon You now, dedicated to Your will
To this love that will remain a love that never fails
