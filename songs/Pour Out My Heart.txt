Here I am, once again 
I pour out my heart 
For I know that You hear 
Every cry You are listening 

No matter what state my heart is in 
You are faithful to answer 
With words that are true 
And a hope that is real 

As I feel Your touch 
You bring a freedom to all that’s within 
In the safety of this place 
I’m longing to… 

Pour out my heart to say that I love You 
Pour out my heart to say that I need You 
Pour out my heart to say that I’m thankful 
Pour out my heart to say that 
You’re wonderful…
