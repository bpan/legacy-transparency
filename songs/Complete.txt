Here I am oh God, I bring this sacrifice 
My open heart, I offer up my life 
I look to You lord, 
Your love that never ends 
Restores me again 

So I lift my eyes to You Lord, 
In Your strength will I break through Lord. 
Touch me now, 
Let Your love fall down on me. 
I know Your love dispels all my fears. 

Through the storm I will hold on Lord 
And by faith I will walk on Lord 
Then Iâ€™ll see beyond my Calvary one day 
And I will be complete in You.
