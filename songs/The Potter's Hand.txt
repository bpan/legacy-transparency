Beautiful Lord, wonderful Savior 
I know for sure, all of my days are… 
Held in Your hands, 
Crafted into Your perfect plan 

You gently call me into Your presence 
Guiding me by Your Holy Spirit 
Teach me dear Lord to live all of my life, 
Through Your eyes 

I’m captured by Your holy calling 
Set me apart, 
I know you’re drawing me to yourself 
Lead me Lord I pray 

Take me, mold me, use me, fill me 
I give me life to the Potter’s Hands 
Call me, guide me, lead me, 
Walk beside me 
I give my life to the Potter’s Hands
