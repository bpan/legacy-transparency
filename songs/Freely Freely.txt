God forgave my sin in Jesus’ name.  
I’ve been born again in Jesus’ name. 
And in Jesus’ name I come to you, 
To share His love as He told me to 

He said “Freely, freely you have received. 
Freely, freely give. 
Go in my name and because you believe 
Others will know that I live.”

All power is given in Jesus’ name; 
In earth and heaven in Jesus’ name. 
And in Jesus’ name I come to you
To share His power as He told me to.
