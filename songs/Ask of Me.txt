Ask of Me, I will give you nations, 
As an inheritance for you,
As an inheritance for you, My children.
Ask of Me, I will give you nations,
As an inheritance for you, ask of Me.

As an inheritance for you,
Here am I, send me to the nations,
As an ambassador for You,
As an ambassador for You, my Father.
Here am I, send me to the nations,
As an ambassador for You, here am I.
