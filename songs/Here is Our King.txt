From wherever spring arrives to heal the ground
From where ever searching comes to look itself
A trace of what we're looking for
so be quiet now, and wait 

The ocean is growing
The tide is coming in
Here it is: 

Here is our King
Here is our Love
Here is our God who's come to bring us back to him
He is the one,
He is Jesus 

And what was said to the rose to make it unfold
Was said to me, here in my chest
So be quiet now, and rest. 

The ocean is growing
The tide is coming in
Here it is: 

Here is our King
Here is our Love
Here is our God who's come to bring us back to him
He is the one,
He is Jesus 

Majesty, finally 
Majesty, finally here (2x)

Here is our King
Here is our Love
Here is our God who's come to bring us back to him
He is the one,
He is Jesus 

Here is our King
Here is our Love
Here is our God who's come to bring us back to him
He is the one,
He is Jesus 

Majesty! 
Finally!
