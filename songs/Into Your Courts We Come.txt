Into Your courts we come, 
Deep in our hearts we long to be. 
Near to the throne of Your glory. 

As we draw near to You, 
Know that weâ€™re here to do Your will. 
Oh how we long to be near to You. 

May our prayers be like incense rising, 
Up to Your throne. 
May our songs be a fragrance unto You. 

May our lives be as pleasing offerings, 
In all that we do, 
God how we long to be near to You.
