Teach me Your ways, oh Lord, 
And I will walk in Your truth. 
Show me Your paths, oh Lord, 
For I am devoted to You. 

Purify my heartâ€™s desire, 
I long to be Your servant. 

Give me an undivided heart, 
That I may fear Your name. 
Give me an undivided heart, 
No other gods, no other love, 
No other gods before You.
