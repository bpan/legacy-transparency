Here I am (here I am), 
Nothing much to give (to You). 
Here I am (here I am), 
Asking for the privilege 
To be used by You, 
I want to be used by You 

Use me, dear Lord, 
Make my life a living sacrifice. 
Use me dear Lord, 
To be a light in the darkest night, 

Lord, for Your glory. 
Lord, for Your glory. 
Lord, for Your glory.
