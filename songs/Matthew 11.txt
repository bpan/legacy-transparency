Come unto Me, all who are weak, 
Weary and heavy laden. 
Gentle am I, humble in heart, 
And you shall find rest for your souls. 

All things are given unto those who believe.  
Princes and lowly ones his kingdom receive  
And just when I think that means everyone but me, 
Jesus comes beckoning to me. 

Enter the holy gates, just as you are.  
No need for a happy face, 
Just come with your heart.  
And Jesus will give us a joyful melody. 
If only His calling we heed. 

We are His little one, the children of God, 
Children and fellow heirs of His kingdom come 
We share the greatest love 
The world has ever seen.  
Here in the Lordâ€™s family.
