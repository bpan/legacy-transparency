Years ago, when I said I’ll follow you, 
I didn’t know 
What it meant to take my cross 
And go against the flow 
To deny myself, to lose my life, to gain it all 

Since I’ve learned, 
Life’s a battlefield and I’m a soldier 
When marching through the evil under fire 
You remain my shield in my darkest hour 

Yes I know, 
Life ain’t no bed of rose, 
So as I go, I will hold to You again 

From the mountaintops 
To the depths of the sea, 
I will always trust in You 
Though the world may label me a fool, 
I believe in You 

Now I know, a servant is no greater 
Than his master 
People hated You and mocked You 
With heir laughter 
To bear Your name, Oh Lord, 
Is my greatest honor 

For my soul, 
You endured all the shame 
For Your love, 
help me stand until the end 
 
Some say I’m crazy, 
That I have no reason to believe in You 
The whole world can try to bring me down 
But I’ll stand on the promise, 
That no one can take me away from You
