You shaped the heavens and the earth, 
Revealed Your splendor; 
You spoke Your life into our hearts, 
So we belong to You. 
 
You are the Maker of all things, First and the Last; 
Creation sings praise to You, God. 
You’re reigning in glory, Ancient of Days; 
Your people sing praise to You, God.
 
Creator God, in You all things 
Now hold together. 
Working Your wonders day by day, 
You’ll reign forever.
 
And earth joins with heaven, 
Declaring Your glory, 
Proclaiming the works of Your hands.
