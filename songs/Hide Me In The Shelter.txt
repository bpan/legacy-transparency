Under the shadow of Your wings 
Here in the secret place of Your holiness, 
I will wait for You. 
Oh Lord my God and King. 

Here in the holiest of all, 
You draw me near with love to abandon all 
For the sake of knowing You 
My Lord and King. 

Hide me in the shelter of Your love. 
Deep in the center of Your heart, my Lord. 
How I want to know You more. 

Keep me in the shadow of Your wings. 
Safe in the secret place of holiness. 
How I need You 
More and more and more.
