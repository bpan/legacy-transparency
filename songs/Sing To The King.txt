Sing to the King who is coming to reign, 
Glory to Jesus, the lamb that was slain 
Life and salvation His empire shall bring, 
Joy to the nations when Jesus is King 

Come let us sing a song, 
A song declaring we belong to Jesus 
He is all we need.  
Lift up a heart of praise 
Say now with voices raised to Jesus, 
Sing to the King 

For His returning we watch and we pray, 
We will be ready the dawn of that day 
Weâ€™ll join in singing with all the redeemed, 
Cause Satan is vanquished 
and Jesus is King
