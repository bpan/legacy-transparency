Father God, I come to You 
Just as I am to seek Your face. 
Take my hand, hold me near 
Let Your love flood my soul once again. 
 
Father, Your love, like a torch in the night 
Will guide the way. 
Father, Your love, gives me power to carry on. 
Father, Your love, like an eagle in flight 
Above the storm. 
Father, Your love, takes away my fear.
 
All I am, and all that I'll be 
Flows from your love to me. 
Love so pure, patient and kind 
Poured out on the cross for me.
