You laid down Your majesty, 
Gave up everything for me, 
Suffered at the hands 
Of those You had created. 

You took all my guilt and shame 
When You died and rose again 
Now alone You reign 
In heaven and earth exalted 

I really want to worship You my Lord 
You have won my heart and I am yours 
Forever, and ever I will love you 

Youâ€™re the only One who died for me, 
Gave Your life to set me free. 
Now I lift my voice to You in adoration.
