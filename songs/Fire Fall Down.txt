You bought my life with the 
Blood that you shed on the cross 
When You died for the sins of men 
And You let out a cry
Crucified now alive in me

These hands are Yours 
Teach them to serve as You please
And I'll reach out desperate to see 
All the greatness of God 
May my soul rest assured in You 

I'll never be the same 
No, I'll never be the same 

Cause I know that You're alive 
You came to fix my broken life 
And I'll sing to glorify Your Holy Name
Jesus Christ 

You changed it all 
You broke down the wall 
When I spoke and confessed 
In You I'm blessed 
Now I walk in the light 
In victorious sight of You 

Your fire fall down 
Fall down 
On us we pray 
As we seek 

Show me Your heart 
Show me Your way 
Show me Your glory
