By our love, the world will see, 
By our love, the world will believe. 
Change our hearts, so that we may see, 
Your heart is broken until 
We are brought to unity. 

We are one, one in You.  
We are one, one in You. 
Let Your fire consume our pride, 
And everything that divides us.  

So that we may love one another.  
So that we may forgive each other.  
So that we may serve one another 
In love.
