I bow down, before You Lord. 
I bow down, before You Lord. 
Holy and faithful, righteous and true, 
You are my King. 

You are Jesus, Youâ€™re my Savior. 
And with all that is within me, 
I bow down, before You.

I kneel down, before You Lord. 
I kneel down, before You Lord. 
Redeemer and Healer, Almighty God, 
You are my King.
