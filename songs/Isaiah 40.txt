Do you not know, have you not heard 
The Lord is the everlasting God. 
The creator of the ends of the earth 
He will not grow tired or weary 

And His understanding 
No one can fathom 
He gives strength to the weary 
And increases the power of the weak.
 
Why do you say O Jacob, and complain O Israel 
“My way is hidden from the Lord.” 
Why do you say O Jacob, and complain O Israel 
“My cause is disregarded by my God.”
 
Even youths grow tired and weary 
Young men stumble and fall.    (2x)
 
But those who hope in the Lord 
Shall renew their strength. 
They will soar on wings, wings like eagles. 
They will run and not, not grow weary 
They will walk and not, not be faint.
 
Alleluia, alleluia…
