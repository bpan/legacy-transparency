I’ve got a river of life flowing out of me; 
Makes the lame to walk 
And the blind to see  
Open prison doors, sets the captives free 
I’ve got a river of life flowing out of me. 

Spring up, O well, within my soul.  
Spring up O well, and make me whole.  
Spring up O well, and give to me. 
That life abundantly.
