You came to us a man, 
In very nature God, 
Pierced for our iniquities 
As You hung upon a cross, 

But God exalted You 
To the highest place.  
And gave to You the right to bear 
The name above all names. 

That at the name of Jesus we should bow. 
And every tongue confess that You are Lord 
And when You come in glory 
For the world to see, we will sing 

Hail to the King 
In all His splendor and majesty. 
Hail to the King of kings, 
Lord Jesus, our God. 

We eagerly await, 
The coming of the day, 
When the glory of the risen King 
Will shine upon the earth. 

Then rival thrones will fall, 
Before the Lord of all, 
And hail supreme authority 
To the true and living God.
