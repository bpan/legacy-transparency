What drew You to me, 
When I was filled with selfishness and sin? 
Lord, what did you see 
For there was nothing good 
That dwelled within. 

What appealed to You 
When I was given only to rebel? 
From where did this grace come. 
That rescued me from an eternal hell? 

It was Your Father’s heart of love for me 
That sent His only Son. 
Your Father’s heart that planned the cross 
To save each hopeless one…like me. 
I can see Your heart of love. 

What drew me to You 
No spark of loving interest in my heart? 
What attracted me 
When I could only stumble in the dark? 

What awakened me 
And called me out of 
Hopelessness and death? 
What unlocked my heart 
And sent upon my soul the Spirit’s breath?
