Father I love you, I need you 
I lay my life before You 
I surrender, to you O Lord 

I lift up my eyes to see my redemption 
With hands lifted high, I give no less 
Than my surrender to You, O Lord 

And I surrender, to You, O Lord my God 
‘Cause I remember the life You brought me from 
And I may never be perfect as You are 

But by Your grace, You’re molding me 
In every way You’re shaping me 
In every place inside of me… 
I surrender
