I’m forgiven because You were forsaken, 
I’m accepted, You were condemned.  
I’m alive and well Your Spirit is within me, 
Because You died and rose again. 

Amazing love, how can it be, 
That You my King would die for me? 
Amazing Love, I know it’s true, 
It’s my joy to honor you, 
In all I do, I honor You. 

You are my King 
You are my King 
(Jesus) You are my King 
(Jesus) You are my King
