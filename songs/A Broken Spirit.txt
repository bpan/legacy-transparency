A broken spirit and a contrite heart 
You will not despise, You will not despise. 
You desire truth in the inward parts, 
A broken spirit and a contrite heart.

Lord my heart is prone to wander, 
Prone to leave the God I love. 
Hereâ€™s my heart, Lord, take and seal it, 
Seal it for Your courts of love.
