Every move I make, I make in You 
You make me move, Jesus 
Every breath I take I breathe in You 

Every step I take, I take in You 
You are my way, Jesus 
Every breath I take, I breathe in You 

Waves of mercy, waves of grace 
Everywhere I look I see Your face 
Your love has captured me 
Oh my God, this love, how can it be? 

La La La La
