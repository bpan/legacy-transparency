There is a Redeemer, 
Jesus God’s own Son.  
Precious Lamb of God.  Messiah 
Holy One. 

Jesus my Redeemer, 
Name above all names, 
Precious Lamb of God, Messiah, 
Hope for sinners slain. 

Thank You O my Father, 
For giving us Your Son. 
And leaving Your Spirit till 
Your work on earth is done. 

When I stand in glory, 
I will see His face. 
And there I’ll serve my King forever 
In that holy place.
