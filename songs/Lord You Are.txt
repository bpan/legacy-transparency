Lord, You are more precious than silver.  
Lord, You are more costly than God. 
Lord, You are more beautiful than diamonds. 
And nothing I desire compares to You. 

Lord, Your love is wider than the oceans. 
Lord, Your love is deeper than the seas. 
Lord, Your love is higher than the mountains. 
And yet You live right here inside of me.
