Take me as I am
I lay down all I thought I should be
And I give up my walls of pride
Hoping love would find me

Take me as I am
I never wanted to need Your love
So alone and afraid to fall
Praying love would find me

And can it be
That You’d love me this way
Never ask me to be
More than I could be
No more trying to be someone

And in  the mirror all I saw
Was that I never measured up
I couldn’t like myself so
How could I understand Your love
And I thought love was something bought
By being someone I was not
How could I know?
All you’d ask is that I let You love me
