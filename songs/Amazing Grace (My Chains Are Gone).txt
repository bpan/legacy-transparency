Amazing grace how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found.
Was blind but now I see.

T’was grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed!

My chains are gone, I’ve been set free
My God my Savior has ransomed me
And like a flood His mercy reigns
Unending love Amazing Grace

The Lord has promised good to me
His Word my hope secures
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
The sun forbear to shine;
But God, who call’d me here below,
Will be forever mine.
