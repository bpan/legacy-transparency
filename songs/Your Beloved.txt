Lord it was You who created the heavens
Lord it was Your hand 
That put the stars in their place

Lord it is Your voice 
That commands the morning
Even oceans and their waves 
Bow at Your feet

Lord, who am I 
Compared to Your glory, oh Lord?
Lord, who am I 
Compared to Your majesty?

I am Your beloved, Your creation, 
And You love me as I am
You have called me chosen 
For Your kingdom,
Unashamed to call me Your own, 
I am Your beloved.
