Lord let Your glory fall, 
As on the ancient day. 
Songs of enduring love, 
And then Your glory came. 

And as a sign to You, 
That we would love the same, 
Our hearts will sing that song, 
God, let Your glory come. 

You are good, You are good, 
And your love endures. (2x) 
You are good, You are good, 
And your love endures today. 

Voices in unison, 
Giving You thanks and praise, 
Joined by the instruments, 
And then Your glory came. 

Your presence like a cloud, 
Upon that ancient day, 
The priests were overwhelmed, 
Because your glory came. 

A sacrifice was made 
And then Your fire came 
They knelt upon the ground 
And then your glory came
