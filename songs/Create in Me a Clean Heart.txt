Create in me a clean heart, O God 
And renew a right spirit within me. 
Create in me a clean heart, O God 
And renew in right spirit within me. 

Cast me not away from thy presence, O Lord 
And take not Thy Holy Spirit from me. 
Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation 
And renew a right spirit within me.
