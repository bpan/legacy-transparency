You are the only one I need, 
I bow all of me at Your feet 
I worship You alone. 

You have given me more than, 
I could ever have wanted, 
And I want to give you 
My heart and my soul. 

You alone are Father 
And You alone are good. 
You alone are Savior 
And You alone are God    

I’m alive, I’m alive, I’m alive, I’m alive
