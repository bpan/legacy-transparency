When I look into Your holiness, 
When I gaze into Your loveliness, 
When all things that surround
Become shadows in the light of You. 
 
When I’ve found the joy of reaching Your heart, 
When my will becomes enthroned in Your love, 
When all things that surround
Become shadows in the light of You.
 
I worship You, 
I worship You. 
The reason I live is to worship You. 
I worship You, 
I worship You. 
The reason I live is to worship You.
