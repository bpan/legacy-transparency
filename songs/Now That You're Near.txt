I stand before You, Lord 
And give you all my praise 
Your love is all I need, 
Jesus, You’re all I need 

My life belongs to You, 
You gave your life for me 
Your grace is all I need – 
Jesus, You’re all I need 

Hold me in Your arms, never let me go 
I want to spend eternity with You 

And now, that You’re near, 
Everything is different. 
Everything’s so different, Lord 

And I know, I’m not the same, 
My life You’ve changed 
I wanna be with You, I wanna be with You 

I’ll sing for You always – 
‘Cause in Your presence God is 
Where I wanna stay
