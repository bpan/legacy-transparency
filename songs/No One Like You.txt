You are more beautiful than anyone, ever.  
Everyday you’re the same, 
You never change, no never. 
And how could I ever deny, 
The love of my savior 
You are to me, everything, all I need forever. 
How could you be so good 

There is no one like you, 
There has never ever been anyone like you 

Everywhere you are there, 
Earth or air surrounding.  
I’m not alone, the heavens sing along, 
My God you’re so astounding.  
How could you be so good to me 
Eternally I believe it. 

How could you be so good to me? 
How could you be so good to me? 
We’re not alone, so sing along 
We’re not alone, so sing along 
Sing along, sing along.
