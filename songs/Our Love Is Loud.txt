When we sing…hear our songs to You 
When we dance…feel us move to You 
When we laugh…fill our smiles with You 
When we lift our voices louder still 
Can You hear us, can You feel… 

We love You Lord, 
We love You, we love You 
We love You Lord, 
We love You, we love You 

When we sing LOUD, hear our songs to You 
When we dance ROUND, feel us move to You 
When we laugh ALOUD, fill our smiles with You 
When we lift  our voices louder still 
Can You hear us, can You feel 

And our love  is big, our love is loud 
Fill this place with this love now 
Our love is big, our love is loud 
Fill  this place with this love  now 

We lift our voices louder still 
Our God is near, Our God is here
