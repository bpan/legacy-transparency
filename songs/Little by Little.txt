Little by little everyday, 
Little by little everyway, 
My Jesus is changing me. 
 
Since I made a turn-about face, 
I’ve been growing in His grace, 
My Jesus is changing me.
 
He’s changing me, my precious Jesus. 
I’m not the same person that I used to be. 
Sometimes it’s slow going, 
But there’s the knowing 
That someday perfect I will be.
