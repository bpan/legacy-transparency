The Lamb is worthy (echo).  
The Lamb is worthy (echo). 
The Lamb who was slain (echo).  
He is worthy, 

To receive power (echo).  
And the riches (echo). 
And the wisdom (echo).  
And the strength. 

And the honor (echo).  
And the glory (echo). 
And the blessings (echo).  
He is worthy, the Lamb who was slain.
