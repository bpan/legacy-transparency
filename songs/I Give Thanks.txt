You have shown me favor unending, 
You have given Your life for me. 
And my heart knows of Your goodness, 
Your blood has covered me. 

I will arise and give thanks 
To You Lord, my God. 
And Your name I will bless, 
With my whole heart. 

You have shown mercy, 
You have shown mercy to me. 
I give thanks to You, Lord. 

You have poured out 
Your healing upon us. 
You have set, the captives free.  
And we know it’s not what we’ve done.  
But by Your hand alone. 

You, oh Lord, are the Healer of our souls. 
You, oh Lord, are the Gracious Redeemer. 
You come to restore us again, 
Yes you come to restore us again, 
And again.
