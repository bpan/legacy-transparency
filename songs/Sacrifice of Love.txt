 I know forever I can stand on Your promises, 
Hold tight to the garment of the Holy One. 
I know forever I can run to Your holiness 
Behold the beauty of Jesus. 
 
So I come only to glorify 
I come cause I want to give You my life 
I come Lord with a sacrifice of love.
 
And so forever I will stand on Your promises, 
Hold tight to the garment of the Holy One. 
And so forever I will run to Your holiness 
Behold the beauty of Jesus.
 
Sacrifice of love.    (3x)
