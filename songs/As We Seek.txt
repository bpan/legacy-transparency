As we seek Your face, 
May we know Your heart
In Your presence, acceptance, 
As we seek Your face. 

At Your feet we fall, 
Sovereign Lord.
We cry holy, holy, 
At Your feet we fall. 

Jesus draw me close, closer Lord to You
Let the world around me fade away.
Jesus draw me close, closer Lord to You
For I desire to worship and obey.
