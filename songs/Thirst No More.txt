Oh Lord I’m thirsty, 
Although I’ve had plenty to drink. 
And Lord I’m hungry, 
Hungrier than I would ever think. 

You know me Lord, and all I’ve ever done. 
I come to the light, you make us one. 
You show me the truth of my present and past. 
And offer me the water that lasts.
 
I want to thirst no more 
I want to hunger no more 
I want to live like Jesus is my Lord. 
I want to thirst no more 
I want to hunger no more 
I want to know that Jesus is enough for me.
