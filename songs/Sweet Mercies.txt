It’s our confession, Lord, that we are weak. 
So very weak, but You are strong. 
And though we’ve nothing, Lord, to lay at Your feet. 
We come to Your feet and say help us along. 
 
A broken heart and a contrite spirit 
You have yet to deny. 
Your heart of mercy beats with love’s strong current. 
Let the river flow by Your Spirit now, 
Lord we cry…
 
Let Your mercies fall from heaven, 
Sweet mercies flow from heaven. 
New mercies for today, 
Shower them down, Lord, as we pray.
