Found love beyond all reason 
You gave Your life, Your all for me 
And called me yours forever

Caught in, the mercy fallout 
Found hope, found life, found all I need 
You’re all I need

The time has come, to stand for all we believe in 
So I for one am gonna give my praise to you

Today, today it’s all or nothing 
All the way, the praise goes out to You 
Yeah all the praise goes out to You

Today, today I live for one thing 
To give You praise, in everything I do 
Yeah all the praise goes out to You

All we are is Yours, 
All we’re living for 
Is all You are, 
Is all that You are
