As we gather may Your Spirit work within us
As we gather may we glorify Your name.
Knowing well that as our hearts begin to worship. 
We’ll be blessed because we came.
We’ll be blessed because we came.  

You have called us by Your Spirit into worship
In this temple You have set our hearts aflame
As we lay our hearts upon Your holy altar.
We’ll be blessed because we came. 
We’ll be blessed because we came.

Let us cleanse our hearts as we begin to worship.
Let us fill our hearts with love for You and sing.
Open up our eyes so we may come to know You.
Unto us the Spirit bring. 
Unto us the Spirit bring.
