Send Your rain, Oh Lord 
Send Your rain, Oh Lord 
Send Your rain…to Your people 

Send Your rain, Oh Lord 
Send Your rain, Oh Lord 
Send Your rain…to Your kingdom 

May Your kingdom come 
And Your will be done 
On the earth…as it is in Heaven 

May Your kingdom come 
And Your will be done 
On the earth…bring Your kingdom 

Soften our hearts! Pour out Your Spirit 
Fill us anew! Let Your rain come!
