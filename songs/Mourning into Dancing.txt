Where there once was only hurt, 
He gave His healing hand. 
Where there once was only pain, 
He brought comfort like a friend. 

And I feel the sweetness of His love 
Piercing my darkness. 
And I see the bright and morning sun 
As it ushers in His joyful gladness.
 
He’s turned my mourning into dancing again, 
He’s lifted my sorrows. 
I can’t stay silent 
I must sing for His joy has come.
 
His anger lasts for a moment in time. 
But His favor is here 
And will be on me for all my lifetime.
