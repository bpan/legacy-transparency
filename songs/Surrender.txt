I’m giving You my heart, 
And all that is within, 
I lay it all down, 
For the sake of You my King. 

I’m giving You my dreams, 
I’m laying down my rights, 
I’m giving up my pride 
For the promise of new life.
 
And, I surrender, all to You, all to You. 
And, I surrender, all to You, all to You.
 
I’m singing You this song, 
I’m waiting at the cross, 
And all the world holds dear, 
I count it all as lost.
 
For the sake of knowing You, 
For the glory of Your name, 
To know the lasting joy, 
Even sharing in Your pain.
