You are Lord of creation 
And Lord of my life, 
Lord of the land and the sea.  
You were Lord of the heavens 
Before there was time. 
And Lord of all Lords You will be. 

We bow down and we worship You Lord 
We bow down and we worship You Lord 
We bow down and we worship You Lord 
Lord of all lords You will be. 

You are King of creation 
And King of my life, 
King of the land and the sea.  
You were King of the heavens 
Before there was time, 
And King of all kings You will be. 

We bow down and we crown You the King 
We bow down and we crown You the King 
We bow down and we crown You the King 
King of all kings You will be.
