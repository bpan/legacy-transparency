Give thanks to the Lord for He is good, 
His love endures forever. 
He made the heavens and the earth, 
His love endures forever. 

He made the sun to give us light, 
His love endures forever. 
The stars and moon to govern the night, 
His love endures forever.

We celebrate Your faithfulness, 
Your mighty hand will deliver  us. 
You’re my Redeemer, You are my King 
All creation sings, “Give thanks to the Lord.”

He delivered the children of Israel, 
His love endures forever. 
He led them through the barren land, 
His love endures forever.

With an outstretched arm 
And a strong right hand, 
His love endures forever. 
He led them into the Promised Land, 
His love endures forever. 
His love endures forever, 
His love endures forever.
